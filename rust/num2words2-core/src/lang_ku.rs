//! Port of `lang_KU.py` (Kurdish / Kurmanji).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_KU` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but its
//! `setup()` defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so the
//! `hasattr` guard in `Num2Word_Base.__init__` never fires: Python never builds
//! `self.cards` and never sets `self.MAXVAL`. `to_cardinal` is overridden
//! outright and drives a hand-written `_int_to_word` recursion. Consequently
//! `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and there is
//! **no overflow check at all** — see bug 1 below for what happens instead.
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` but overridden by KU (so the trait defaults
//! are *not* used):
//!   * `to_ordinal`     — KU's own; notably does **not** call `verify_ordinal`,
//!     which is why negative ordinals succeed instead of raising (bug 4).
//!   * `to_ordinal_num` — KU's own: `str(number) + "em"`.
//!   * `to_year`        — KU's own: ignores `longval` and the base class's
//!     BC/AD machinery, delegating straight to `to_cardinal`.
//!
//! `setup()` also assigns `self.exclude_title = ["û", "xal", "negatîv"]`, but
//! `Num2Word_Base.__init__` leaves `is_title = False` and KU's `to_cardinal`
//! never calls `self.title()`. The list is therefore dead — `is_title()` and
//! `exclude_title()` are left at their trait defaults deliberately.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. Every item below looks wrong and is exactly
//! what Python emits; each is pinned by a row in the frozen corpus.
//!
//! 1. **`_int_to_word` gives up at 10^9 and returns bare digits.** The final
//!    `return str(number)` has no word forms behind it, so `to_cardinal(10**9)`
//!    == `"1000000000"` — the *numeral*, not words. There is no "milyar"
//!    branch. This is the de facto ceiling, and it degrades silently rather
//!    than raising `OverflowError`. Hence `to_ordinal(10**9)` ==
//!    `"1000000000em"`, identical to `to_ordinal_num(10**9)`.
//! 2. **Asymmetric "yek" suppression.** The hundreds branch suppresses the
//!    multiplier for exactly one hundred (`if h > 1`), so 100 == `"sed"`, but
//!    the thousand and million branches recurse unconditionally, so 1000 ==
//!    `"yek hezar"` and 10^6 == `"yek milyon"`. The suppression then leaks
//!    through the recursion: 100000 == `"sed hezar"` (not "yek sed hezar") and
//!    10^8 == `"sed milyon"`.
//! 3. **Ordinals concatenate "em" with no separator or elision**, producing a
//!    doubled vowel on words already ending in "e"/"ê": `to_ordinal(3)` ==
//!    `"sêem"`, `to_ordinal(10)` == `"dehem"`. Preserved verbatim.
//! 4. **Negative ordinals do not raise.** KU's `to_ordinal` skips
//!    `verify_ordinal`, so `to_ordinal(-1)` == `"negatîv yekem"` — the "em"
//!    lands on the end of a negated cardinal. `to_ordinal_num(-1)` == `"-1em"`.
//! 5. **`tens[1]` ("deh") is unreachable.** The `< 100` branch only runs for
//!    `number >= 20` (10..19 is consumed by `teens`), so the tens quotient is
//!    never 1. Kept in the table for positional fidelity.
//! 6. **`to_ordinal(1)`'s special case is a no-op.** `if number == 1: return
//!    "yekem"` produces exactly what the general path would (`to_cardinal(1)`
//!    + `"em"` == `"yek"` + `"em"`). Harmless, but reproduced as written.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `Num2Word_KU` declares its **own** `CURRENCY_FORMS` class attribute, so it is
//! untouched by the `lang_EUR` / `Num2Word_EN.__init__` mutation trap described
//! in PORTING_CURRENCY.md — EN mutates `Num2Word_EUR`'s dict, and KU does not
//! share it. The live table is exactly the source literal, four codes wide.
//! `CURRENCY_PRECISION` and `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` are both `{}`, so
//! `currency_precision` (always 100) and `currency_adjective` (always `None`)
//! stay at their trait defaults.
//!
//! KU overrides `to_currency` outright and defines `pluralize`. Everything else
//! on the currency path — `to_cheque`, `_money_verbose`, `_cents_verbose`,
//! `_cents_terse` — is inherited from `Num2Word_Base` unchanged, and the trait
//! defaults already mirror those.
//!
//! ## More faithfully reproduced Python bugs
//!
//! 7. **An unknown currency code does not raise; it silently becomes TRY.**
//!    `to_currency` looks the code up with
//!    `CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, list(CURRENCY_FORMS.values())[0])`, and that
//!    default is the *first inserted* entry — TRY. So `to_currency(0, "JPY")` is
//!    `"sifir lîre"`, quietly denominated in Turkish lira. Only `to_cheque`,
//!    which is Base's and subscripts the dict, raises NotImplementedError. The
//!    corpus pins both halves: every one of the nine codes it exercises returns
//!    a value through `to_currency`, while GBP/JPY/KWD/BHD/INR/CNY/CHF raise
//!    through `to_cheque`.
//! 8. **`cents=False` drops the subunit segment instead of writing it tersely.**
//!    Base would emit `"... 56"` via `_cents_terse`; KU's `if cents and right:`
//!    just omits it, so `to_currency(12.34, "USD", cents=False)` is
//!    `"donzdeh dolar"`.
//! 9. **`adjective=` is accepted and then completely ignored.** KU never touches
//!    `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` (which is empty anyway), so `adjective=True` changes
//!    nothing.
//! 10. **Cents are truncated to two digits, not rounded, and short fractions are
//!     right-padded.** `int(parts[1][:2].ljust(2, "0"))` means `12.345` -> 34
//!     (not 35), `12.005` -> `int("00")` -> 0 -> *no cents at all*, `0.099` -> 9,
//!     and `1.5` -> 50. A 3-decimal currency gets no special treatment: KU has no
//!     `CURRENCY_PRECISION`, so KWD is truncated at 2 digits like everything else
//!     (and falls back to TRY's forms per bug 7 regardless).
//! 11. **Bug 1's digit fallback leaks into money.** `to_currency` calls
//!     `_int_to_word` directly, so `to_currency(10**9, "USD")` is
//!     `"1000000000 dolar"` and `to_currency(1234567890.12, "USD")` is
//!     `"1234567890 dolar donzdeh sent"`.
//! 12. **`pluralize` is dead code.** KU defines it, but `to_currency` inlines its
//!     own `cr1[1] if left != 1 else cr1[0]` and Base's `to_cheque` takes `cr1[-1]`
//!     unconditionally, so nothing in the library reaches it. It is ported anyway
//!     (the trait default *raises*, which would be wrong for KU) and differs from
//!     `Num2Word_EUR.pluralize`: it returns `forms[-1]`, not `forms[1]`, and
//!     answers `""` for an empty tuple rather than raising IndexError.
//! 13. **The separator is concatenated with no following space.** Base formats
//!     `"%s%s %s %s"`, putting a space *after* the separator; KU writes
//!     `result += separator + self._int_to_word(right) + " " + ...`. KU's own
//!     default (`" "`) hides this, but an explicit `separator=","` yields
//!     `"donzdeh dolar,sî û çar sent"` where Base's languages give `", sî..."`.
//!
//! Note that all four of KU's entries — and TRY's fallback — carry *identical*
//! singular and plural forms (`("lîre", "lîre")`), so the `left != 1` branch is
//! unobservable through the shipped table. It is ported literally regardless.
//!
//! # Notes on the port
//!
//! Python's `to_cardinal` is string-driven: it does `n = str(number).strip()`,
//! tests `n.startswith("-")`, and recurses on the substring `n[1:]`. For
//! integral input that is exactly "negate and recurse on the absolute value",
//! which is what [`LangKu::cardinal`] does. The `"." in n` branch (float input)
//! is out of scope per PORTING.md and omitted.
//!
//! `_int_to_word` is never reached with a negative: `to_cardinal` strips the
//! sign before calling it. (Were it, Python's negative list indexing would make
//! `self.ones[-1]` == "neh" — a latent trap this port cannot hit, since the
//! only in-scope caller guarantees a non-negative argument.)
