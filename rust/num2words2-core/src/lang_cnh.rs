//! Port of `lang_CNH.py` (Hakha Chin).
//!
//! Registry check: `CONVERTER_CLASSES["cnh"]` is `lang_CNH.Num2Word_CNH`, which
//! is the class ported here.
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_CNH` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so Python's
//! `__init__` never builds `self.cards` and never sets `self.MAXVAL`. All four
//! in-scope modes (`to_cardinal`, `to_ordinal`, `to_ordinal_num`, `to_year`)
//! are overridden outright, so **nothing** is inherited from `Num2Word_Base`
//! and `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults. In particular
//! `splitnum`/`clean`/`merge` are never reached, and there is no overflow
//! check of any kind — see bug 1 below for what happens instead.
//!
//! Everything runs through the private `_int_to_word` helper, which handles
//! 0..10^9-1 by 1/2/3-digit chunking and gives up above that.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python behaviour
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. The following all look wrong but are exactly
//! what Python emits, each verified against a `bench/corpus.jsonl` row:
//!
//! 1. **`_int_to_word` silently degrades to digits at 10^9.** The chain of
//!    `if number < ...` tests ends at `1000000000`; past it the function just
//!    `return str(number)`. So `to_cardinal(10**9)` == `"1000000000"` — bare
//!    digits, no words, and *no* `OverflowError`. This is CNH's de facto
//!    MAXVAL, and it leaks into the other modes: `to_ordinal(10**9)` ==
//!    `"1000000000-nak"`, and `to_year` likewise. Corpus confirms this all the
//!    way up to 10^21 (`"1000000000000000000000"`), which is why the value
//!    stays a `BigInt` here and is never cast to a fixed-width int.
//! 2. **Hundreds join with `" le "`, thousands and millions join with a bare
//!    space.** `101` == `"pakhat phazar le pakhat"` but `1001` ==
//!    `"pakhat thawngkhat pakhat"` and `1000001` == `"pakhat milin pakhat"`.
//!    The asymmetry is in the source (`" le " + ...` vs `" " + ...`) and is
//!    preserved verbatim.
//! 3. **`to_ordinal` accepts negatives and zero.** `Num2Word_Base.verify_ordinal`
//!    is never called, so `to_ordinal(-1)` == `"minus pakhat-nak"` and
//!    `to_ordinal(0)` == `"zero-nak"` rather than raising `TypeError`. The
//!    `-nak` suffix attaches to the *whole* phrase, so `to_ordinal(-999)` ==
//!    `"minus pakua phazar le pakua kip le pakua-nak"`.
//! 4. **`to_ordinal_num` does not go through `to_cardinal`,** so it keeps the
//!    minus sign as a digit prefix: `to_ordinal_num(-42)` == `"-42-nak"`.
//! 5. **`tens[1]` breaks the pattern.** 20..90 are `"<unit> kip"`, but 10 is
//!    `"pahra"`, not `"pakhat kip"`. Kept as-is.
//! 6. **English words survive in a Hakha Chin table:** `_int_to_word(0)` is
//!    `"zero"` (not a Chin numeral), and `setup` sets `pointword = "decimal"`
//!    and `negword = "minus "`. Not our problem to fix.
//! 7. **`exclude_title` / `is_title` are dead config.** `setup` populates
//!    `exclude_title = ["minus", "decimal", "le"]`, but CNH's `to_cardinal`
//!    never calls `self.title()` (unlike `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal`), so the
//!    list can never take effect. Mirrored on the trait anyway for fidelity.
//! 8. **`to_year` ignores its `longval` parameter** entirely — the body is just
//!    `return self.to_cardinal(val)`, so years get no era/pairing treatment
//!    and negatives come out as `"minus panga phazar"` for -500.
//!
//! # The currency surface
//!
//! `Num2Word_CNH` defines its own `CURRENCY_FORMS` (three codes) and overrides
//! `to_currency` and `pluralize`. It inherits `to_cheque`, `_money_verbose`,
//! `_cents_verbose`, `_cents_terse`, `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` (`{}`) and
//! `CURRENCY_PRECISION` (`{}`) from `Num2Word_Base` untouched. There is no
//! `lang_EUR`/`lang_EU` in the MRO — `Num2Word_CNH -> Num2Word_Base -> object`
//! — so the `Num2Word_EN.__init__` mutation of the shared `Num2Word_EUR`
//! class dict (the trap `PORTING_CURRENCY.md` warns about) does not reach this
//! table. Verified against the live interpreter: CNH's `CURRENCY_FORMS` is
//! exactly its own three-entry literal, and both `CURRENCY_PRECISION` and
//! `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` are empty dicts.
//!
//! More reproduced Python behaviour, all corpus-confirmed:
//!
//! 9. **`to_currency` never raises for an unknown code.** It looks the code up
//!    with `.get(currency, list(self.CURRENCY_FORMS.values())[0])`, so anything
//!    outside `{MMK, USD, EUR}` silently becomes **MMK** — the first value in
//!    the dict's insertion order. `to_currency(1, "GBP")` == `"pakhat kyat"`,
//!    not a `NotImplementedError`. `to_cheque` is the opposite: it inherits
//!    `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque`, which subscripts `self.CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]`
//!    and converts the `KeyError` into `NotImplementedError`. So the same
//!    "GBP" is kyats through one entry point and an exception through the
//!    other. The fallback therefore lives *only* inside `to_currency`;
//!    `currency_forms()` (which is what `default_to_cheque` calls) does a plain
//!    lookup and returns `None`.
//! 10. **`to_currency` ignores `adjective` entirely.** The parameter is in the
//!    signature and never read. Moot in practice — `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` is
//!    empty — but ported as written.
//! 11. **`to_currency` ignores `CURRENCY_PRECISION`.** It hard-codes two
//!    fractional digits via `parts[1][:2].ljust(2, "0")` rather than consulting
//!    a divisor, so neither the 3-decimal (KWD/BHD) nor the 0-decimal (JPY)
//!    convention exists here. `to_currency(12.34, "JPY")` renders a cents
//!    segment — `"pahra le pahnih kyat pathum kip le pali pya"` — where a
//!    precision-aware language would round to whole yen. Doubly moot since
//!    CNH's `CURRENCY_PRECISION` is `{}` (every code is 100), but it means
//!    `Num2Word_Base.to_currency`'s zero-decimal pre-rounding branch is dead
//!    code for CNH, and so `crate::currency::default_to_currency` is never
//!    reached.
//! 12. **`to_currency` does not use `pluralize`.** It open-codes the choice as
//!    `cr1[1] if left != 1 else cr1[0]`, indexing the form tuple directly. So
//!    `pluralize` — which CNH does override — is dead code: nothing in the
//!    class or in `Num2Word_Base` calls it once `to_currency` is overridden.
//!    Ported anyway, since it is a public method a caller could invoke.
//! 13. **`to_currency` collapses the int/float distinction that
//!    `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` is built around.** The base branches on
//!    `isinstance(val, int)` to decide whether cents appear; CNH never looks at
//!    the type, it only asks whether `str(val)` contains a `"."`. The two agree
//!    by accident for `1` (no dot -> no cents) and, via a *different* rule, for
//!    `1.0`: `parts[1]` is `"0"`, so `right` is `0`, which is falsy, so the
//!    `if cents and right:` segment is skipped. Both render `"pakhat euro"`.
//!    That is CNH's own doing, not a collapse introduced by this port — the
//!    `Int`/`Decimal` arms below are kept apart and reach the same place by the
//!    routes Python takes.
//! 14. **Zero cents are dropped, and `cents=False` drops the segment
//!    entirely.** `if cents and right:` is a truthiness test on both. So
//!    `to_currency(12.00, "EUR")` == `"pahra le pahnih euro"` (no `"zero
//!    cent"`), and `cents=False` yields no cents at all rather than falling
//!    back to `_cents_terse`'s digit form.
//! 15. **Cents truncate, they never round.** `parts[1][:2]` slices the decimal
//!    text. `to_currency(0.999, "EUR")` takes `"99"`, not 100 — no carry into
//!    the units.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! The four integer modes are total: `ones`/`tens` are only ever indexed 0..=9
//! (guarded by `< 10` and by `divmod` on a value `< 100`), the `>= 10^9`
//! fallback returns a string instead of raising, and no dict lookup exists to
//! `KeyError` on. `Result` is returned only to satisfy the trait.
//!
//! The float/Decimal *entries* add exactly one error: `N2WError::Value` from
//! `int(n)` when `str(number)` carries no `"."` and is not plain digits — the
//! exponential forms of bug 22. `to_ordinal_num` never raises (it never calls
//! `int()`), which is why `to_ordinal_num(1e16)` is `"1e+16-nak"` while
//! `to_ordinal(1e16)` is a ValueError.
//!
//! The currency surface has exactly two error paths:
//!
//! * `to_cheque` with a code outside `{MMK, USD, EUR}` -> `NotImplemented`,
//!   from `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque`'s `KeyError` -> `NotImplementedError`
//!   conversion.
//! * `to_currency` on a value whose `str()` is in scientific notation ->
//!   `Value`, because `int("1e+16")` is a `ValueError`. See
//!   [`LangCnh::split_currency`].
//!
//! # The float / Decimal cardinal path
//!
//! `Num2Word_CNH` does **not** override `to_cardinal_float`; it routes
//! non-integers back through its own `to_cardinal`, whose `"." in n` branch
//! (module route below, bug 16) is what actually renders them. So the trait's
//! `to_cardinal_float` is overridden here to reproduce that branch rather than
//! inherit `floatpath::default_to_cardinal_float`. Two facts make it a
//! *different* algorithm from the base float path:
//!
//! 16. **CNH renders the raw `str(number)` digits — no `float2tuple`, no
//!     rounding.** The base path computes `post = abs(value-pre) * 10**precision`
//!     in binary f64 and leans on a `< 0.01` heuristic to rescue artefacts like
//!     `2.675 -> 674.9999… -> 675`. CNH never does any of that: it takes the
//!     characters of `str(number)` after the `"."` verbatim, so `2.675` renders
//!     `paruk parih panga` (6 7 5) straight off the repr. The whole trap the
//!     base path exists to survive simply does not apply.
//! 17. **`self.precision` is never read, so the `precision=` kwarg has no
//!     effect.** `Num2Word_CNH.to_cardinal(number)` takes no `precision`
//!     argument and never consults `self.precision`; the digit count is
//!     `len(str(number).split(".")[1])`, fixed by the repr. Verified live:
//!     `num2words(2.675, lang="cnh", precision=1)` still yields all three
//!     fractional words. `precision_override` is therefore ignored.
//! 18. **Each fractional digit is a *single* `ones` word (or `"zero"`).** The
//!     loop is `ret += " " + (self.ones[int(digit)] or "zero")`, so `0` becomes
//!     `"zero"` (because `ones[0]` is the falsy `""`) and `1..9` become the bare
//!     unit word — never the tens/hundreds machinery. `0.01` is
//!     `"zero decimal zero pakhat"`, digit by digit.
//! 19. **The integer part still goes through `_int_to_word(int(left))`,** so it
//!     inherits every integer quirk, including bug 1: the Decimal
//!     `98746251323029.99` renders its left part as bare digits
//!     `"98746251323029"` (past 10^9) followed by `"decimal pakua pakua"`.
//! 20. **Sign is detected from the *text*, `str(number).startswith("-")`,** not
//!     a numeric `< 0`. That matters only for negative zero: `str(-0.0)` is
//!     `"-0.0"`, so `to_cardinal(-0.0)` is `"minus zero decimal zero"`. The
//!     Float arm below uses `f64::is_sign_negative()` (the sign *bit*) to match,
//!     deliberately **not** `FloatValue::is_negative()` (a `< 0.0` test, which
//!     reads `-0.0` as positive). No corpus row exercises `-0.0`; this keeps the
//!     untested edge faithful anyway.
//!
//! 21. **Whole floats keep their ".0" tail.** Routing is `"." in str(number)`,
//!     and `str(5.0)` is `"5.0"`, so `to_cardinal(5.0)` == `"panga decimal
//!     zero"` — never Base's whole-value integer route. `Decimal("5")` (str
//!     `"5"`, no dot) *does* take the integer path. `cardinal_float_entry`
//!     carries this routing; `ordinal`/`year` inherit it by composition
//!     (`to_ordinal(5.0)` == `"panga decimal zero-nak"`, `to_year(5.0)` ==
//!     `"panga decimal zero"`), and `to_ordinal_num(5.0)` suffixes the raw
//!     repr: `"5.0-nak"`.
//! 22. **Exponential string forms raise ValueError.** `str(1e16)` ==
//!     `"1e+16"` and `str(Decimal("1E+2"))` == `"1E+2"` contain no `"."`, so
//!     they fall through to `int(n)`, which raises `ValueError: invalid
//!     literal for int() with base 10: '1e+16'`. The same route kills string
//!     input `"1e3"` (`Decimal("1e3")` -> str `"1E+3"` -> `int` ValueError)
//!     and `"Infinity"`/`"NaN"` (`int("Infinity")` / `int("NaN")` ->
//!     ValueError — see [`Lang::str_to_number`] below for how the binding's
//!     hard-wired OverflowError is pre-empted for Inf). Corpus-pinned for
//!     1e+16/1e+20 (float), 1E+2/1E+20 (Decimal) and "1e3"/"1E3"/"Infinity"/
//!     "-Infinity"/"NaN" (str) across cardinal/ordinal/year.
//!
//! `cardinal_from_decimal` (the fractional-cents entry point) still stays at its
//! trait default: CNH's `to_currency` hard-slices two decimal digits out of the
//! text and never hands a fractional cent count downstream, so it is never
//! reached — see the currency notes above.
//!
//! # Cross-call state
//!
//! None. `Num2Word_CNH` stashes no flag in one method for another to consume
//! (no `_pending_ordinal`-style handshake), so the stateless Rust path is a
//! faithful substitute and the dispatcher needs no special-casing. The
//! `CURRENCY_FORMS` table is immutable after construction.
