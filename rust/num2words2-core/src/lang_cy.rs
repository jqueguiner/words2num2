//! Port of `lang_CY.py` (Welsh).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_CY` subclasses `Num2Word_EUR` →
//! `Num2Word_Base`, but it overrides `__init__` with a bare `pass`. That single
//! line severs the whole inherited setup chain:
//!
//!   * `Num2Word_Base.__init__` never runs, so `setup()` is never called and
//!     `Num2Word_EUR.setup`'s `high_numwords` is never built.
//!   * `self.cards` and `self.MAXVAL` are therefore never created, and
//!     `set_high_numwords` / `gen_high_numwords` / `splitnum` / `clean` /
//!     `merge` are all dead code for this language.
//!   * `self.negword`, `self.pointword`, `self.is_title`, `self.precision` and
//!     the `errmsg_*` strings are likewise never assigned. CY substitutes its
//!     own class-level `MINUS_PREFIX_WORD = "meinws "` /
//!     `FLOAT_INFIX_WORD = " pwynt "` and hardcodes `("meinws", None)` into the
//!     word list, so nothing in the four in-scope modes ever touches the
//!     missing attributes.
//!
//! Consequently `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and
//! `to_cardinal` is overridden outright. The ceiling is CY's own explicit
//! `999 * 10**33` guard, which raises **NotImplementedError** — not the
//! `OverflowError` that `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal` would have raised.
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` (CY does not override either, so the trait
//! defaults are correct):
//!   * `to_ordinal_num(value) -> value` → default `Ok(value.to_string())`.
//!     Note Python returns the **int itself**, not a string; the corpus
//!     stringifies it, which the trait default reproduces.
//!   * `to_year(value, **kwargs) -> self.to_cardinal(value)` → the default
//!     delegates through `&self` and picks up the `to_cardinal` override below.
//!     Welsh has no special year form; `to_year(1999)` == `to_cardinal(1999)`.
//!
//! # How Welsh numerals work here
//!
//! The algorithm never builds a plain string until the very end. Every table
//! entry is a `(word, mutation)` pair where `mutation` describes the consonant
//! mutation this word triggers on the word that *follows* it (soft "SM" or
//! aspirate "AM"). [`makestring`] walks the assembled list, applies each
//! pending mutation to the next word, and joins with single spaces. Numerals
//! are vigesimal (base-20): 30 is "deg ar hugain" (ten on twenty), 80 is
//! "pedwar ugain" (four twenties), and 50-59 have a special "hanner (cant)"
//! (half a hundred) form.
//!
//! `OBJ` (`"__OBJECT__"`) is a placeholder marking where a counted noun would
//! be inserted (Welsh puts the noun *between* numeral parts). The `counted=`
//! kwarg that fills it is out of scope — the dispatcher's Rust fast path only
//! fires when no kwargs are present — so every `OBJ` is dropped here. See the
//! bug list below for why dropping it is nonetheless load-bearing.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs and quirks
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. All of the following are exactly what Python
//! emits, verified against the frozen corpus:
//!
//! 1. **`makestring`'s `continue` leaks the pending mutation across `OBJ`.**
//!    When an `OBJ` entry is skipped (`counted` is None), Python `continue`s
//!    *before* `lastmut = mut` runs, so the `OBJ`'s own `None` mutation is
//!    never consumed and the previous word's mutation survives to hit the next
//!    real word. This is what makes `200` == "dau gant" work: the list is
//!    `[("dau","SM"), (OBJ,None), ("cant",None)]`, and "cant" is soft-mutated
//!    to "gant" only because `OBJ` failed to clear the "SM". With a `counted`
//!    noun present the mutation would land on the noun instead and "cant" would
//!    stay unmutated. Modelled exactly in [`makestring`].
//! 2. **`CARDINAL_WORDS[19]` and `CARDINAL_WORDS_FEM[19]` are missing their
//!    `OBJ`** — every other entry in both tables has one. `19` is the only
//!    value whose counted noun therefore has nowhere to go. Kept verbatim;
//!    harmless in scope (all `OBJ`s are dropped anyway) but the asymmetry is
//!    clearly unintentional.
//! 3. **`ORDINAL_WORDS_FEM` is dead code.** `hundred_group` picks its table as
//!    `if gender == "fem": CW = CARDINAL_WORDS_FEM` *before* it ever checks
//!    `ordinal`, so a feminine ordinal silently falls back to the feminine
//!    **cardinal** words. Nothing in the module references
//!    `ORDINAL_WORDS_FEM`. It is transcribed below for the record but,
//!    faithfully, never read.
//! 4. **No "a"/"ac" conjunction between magnitude groups.** `1001` is
//!    "mil un", not "mil ac un"; `2001` is "dwy fil un". The `ac`/`a` join is
//!    only ever emitted *inside* `hundred_group`, between a hundreds part and
//!    its own remainder.
//! 5. **The `ac` list is tested against `until100`, not against the units.**
//!    So `1776` → "mil saith cant **a un** ar bymtheg a thrigain": the
//!    remainder is 76, which is not in the `ac` list, so "a" is chosen even
//!    though the word it precedes is "un" (which *would* have taken "ac" had
//!    the check been on the unit). Reproduced by [`AC_VALUES`].
//! 6. **`lowestgroup` compares group *values*, not positions.**
//!    `ordinal and (lowestgroup == gr)` matches any group whose value equals
//!    the lowest non-zero group's value, so `to_cardinal(1_000_001, ordinal=True)`
//!    would ordinalize both the millions and the units group. Unreachable from
//!    the four in-scope modes (see `to_ordinal`'s range gate below), but the
//!    comparison is ported as written rather than "fixed" to a position check.
//! 7. **`to_ordinal` raises `KeyError` for every negative input.** The guard is
//!    `if number < 20: return makestring(ORDINAL_WORDS[number])`, and every
//!    negative satisfies `< 20`, so `ORDINAL_WORDS[-1]` misses the dict. It is
//!    a crash, not a deliberate raise, but the exception *type* is observable —
//!    hence `N2WError::Key` and not a tidy `TypeError`. `to_cardinal` is
//!    unaffected (it strips the sign first) and `to_ordinal_num` is unaffected
//!    (it returns the input untouched).
//!
//! # Float / Decimal routing (the entry hooks)
//!
//! CY's `isinstance(number, float)` guard fires for **every** float, whole
//! values included: `to_cardinal(1.0)` is "un pwynt dim", never "un". So
//! [`Lang::cardinal_float_entry`] is overridden to skip the base default's
//! whole-value shortcut entirely — floats always take [`LangCy::float_to_words`],
//! Decimals always take the integer branch ([`LangCy::decimal_to_cardinal`]).
//! `to_year` is Base's `to_cardinal(value)`, so the default
//! `year_float_entry` (→ `cardinal_float_entry`) is already right.
//!
//! `to_ordinal(float/Decimal)` is its own zoo ([`Lang::ordinal_float_entry`]):
//!
//! * `number < 20` → `ORDINAL_WORDS[number]`. A float/Decimal key hits the
//!   dict iff it hash-equals an int key 0..=19: `5.0` → "pumed",
//!   `-0.0` → "dimfed" (`-0.0 == 0`), while `0.5`, `-1.0`, `Decimal('-3.0')`
//!   all raise **KeyError**.
//! * `number == 100` → "canfed" (`1E+2` included); `> 100` →
//!   NotImplementedError — so `to_ordinal(101.0)` raises where
//!   `to_cardinal(101.0)` renders.
//! * 20 ≤ n < 100 → `to_cardinal(n, ordinal=True)`. For a *float* the
//!   isinstance guard wins first and `ordinal=True` is silently ignored:
//!   `to_ordinal(21.0)` is the **cardinal** "un ar hugain pwynt dim". A
//!   Decimal reaches the integer branch with `ordinal=True` live:
//!   `to_ordinal(Decimal('42'))` is "ail a deugain".
//!
//! `float_to_words` reads the digits out of `str(abs_float)`. Python repr
//! picks exponent notation at `abs >= 1e16` (and below `1e-4`), where
//! `.split(".")[1]` raises **IndexError** ("1e+16" has no dot) or the
//! digit-by-digit `int(c)` hits the 'e' and raises **ValueError**
//! ("1.5e+16"). The prefix `to_cardinal(int(abs_float))` is computed *before*
//! the split, so a float past `999 * 10**33` raises NotImplementedError
//! first. Reproduced via [`py_float_str`].
//!
//! `Decimal('Infinity')` / `Decimal('NaN')` parse fine in `str_to_number` and
//! only blow up inside `to_cardinal`: the `not number < 999 * 10**33` ceiling
//! raises **NotImplementedError** for ±Infinity, and `number < 0` raises
//! **decimal.InvalidOperation** for NaN. The binding's generic Inf/NaN arms
//! raise Base's OverflowError/ValueError instead, so [`Lang::str_to_number`]
//! is overridden to return NotImplemented for Inf/NaN — the shim then reruns
//! the original Python string path, which owns those raises exactly.
//!
//! # Fractions
//!
//! CY inherits `Num2Word_Base.to_fraction`, whose negative branch is
//! `sign = "%s " % self.negword.strip()` — and the `pass` `__init__` never
//! created `self.negword`, so **any negative fraction raises AttributeError**
//! (`-1/2`, `1/-2`; `-3/-4` is positive and renders). The sign is computed
//! before the numerator/denominator words, so the AttributeError beats the
//! KeyError/NotImplementedError those would raise. Ported as a local
//! override rather than the trait default precisely for that raise.
//!
//! # Grammatical kwargs
//!
//! `to_cardinal(number, informal=False, gender="masc", ordinal=False,
//! counted=None, raw=False)` and `to_ordinal(number, informal=False,
//! gender="masc")` are the live signatures ([`Lang::to_cardinal_kw`] /
//! [`Lang::to_ordinal_kw`]):
//!
//! * `informal` is accepted and ignored (its only use site is commented out).
//! * `gender` only ever matters as the literal comparison `== "fem"` — "f",
//!   "m", None, 1 all fall to masculine.
//! * `counted` fills the first `OBJ` below 100 ("un ci ar hugain") and turns
//!   into the partitive `o <noun>` (soft mutation: "o gi") at 100 and above.
//!   Zero returns before `counted` is consulted: `to_cardinal(0, counted="ci")`
//!   is plain "dim".
//! * `raw=True` returns the word list itself; the corpus stringifies it, so
//!   [`py_repr_wordlist`] reproduces the Python `repr` of a list of
//!   `(str, str|None)` tuples byte for byte.
//! * `ordinal=` never reaches the converter through `num2words` — the
//!   dispatcher's own `ordinal` parameter shadows it and rewrites `to`
//!   — so it is deliberately NOT in the kwargs guard.
//!
//! `to_year(value, **kwargs)` is Base's and swallows *every* kwarg, so
//! [`Lang::to_year_kw`] accepts anything and returns the cardinal.
//! `to_ordinal_num` and `to_currency` take no extra kwargs — the trait
//! defaults (fall back to Python's TypeError) are already exact.
//!
//! # The currency surface
//!
//! `Num2Word_CY` overrides `to_currency`, `_money_verbose` and
//! `_cents_verbose`; it inherits `pluralize` from `Num2Word_EUR` and
//! `to_cheque` / `_cents_terse` from `Num2Word_Base` (all four confirmed on the
//! live interpreter via `__func__.__qualname__`).
//!
//! Two consequences of the `pass` __init__ dominate this surface:
//!
//! 1. **`self.negword` never exists**, and `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` reaches
//!    for it — `minus_str = "%s " % self.negword.strip() if is_negative else ""`.
//!    Python's conditional expression only evaluates the left operand when
//!    `is_negative` is true, so a *positive* float is fine and a **negative
//!    float raises `AttributeError`**. See [`N2WError::Attribute`] below and
//!    module bug 8.
//! 2. **`CURRENCY_PRECISION` is `Num2Word_Base`'s shared `{}`** (verified:
//!    `Num2Word_CY.CURRENCY_PRECISION is Num2Word_Base.CURRENCY_PRECISION`).
//!    `Num2Word_EN.__init__` *rebinds* rather than mutates it, so EN's mils
//!    table does not leak here. Every code is therefore divisor 100 — CY has no
//!    3-decimal and no 0-decimal currency, and `currency_precision` stays at its
//!    trait default. The `divisor == 1` branch of `default_to_currency` is
//!    unreachable for Welsh.
//!
//! ## `CURRENCY_FORMS` is CY's own dict, not the mutated EUR one
//!
//! The usual `lang_EUR.py` trap does **not** apply: `Num2Word_CY` rebinds
//! `CURRENCY_FORMS` in its own class body, so it is a fresh dict object and
//! `Num2Word_EN.__init__`'s in-place mutation of `Num2Word_EUR.CURRENCY_FORMS`
//! never touches it (verified: `Num2Word_CY.CURRENCY_FORMS is
//! Num2Word_EUR.CURRENCY_FORMS` → `False`). It holds exactly four codes —
//! EUR, USD, GBP, CNY — and EN's ~24 added codes are **absent**. JPY, KWD, BHD,
//! INR and CHF all raise `NotImplementedError` on the float path, as the corpus
//! records.
//!
//! `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`, by contrast, *is* the shared `Num2Word_EUR` object
//! (verified `is` → `True`) and nothing mutates it, so its 16 entries are
//! inherited verbatim. Only `USD` is both adjectivised and present in CY's
//! forms, so `adjective=True` is observable for USD alone.
//!
//! # More faithfully reproduced Python bugs (currency)
//!
//! 8. **`to_currency` ignores `currency=` entirely for `int` input.** CY's
//!    override intercepts `isinstance(val, int)` *before* delegating to
//!    `super()`, and its branch never consults `CURRENCY_FORMS`. So every int
//!    is denominated in mutated GBP — `to_currency(2, "JPY")` is
//!    `"dau bunnoedd"`, not an error and not yen. This is why the corpus shows
//!    `currency:JPY` / `currency:KWD` / `currency:CHF` succeeding for `0`, `1`,
//!    `2`, `100`, `1000000` while every float with the same code raises
//!    `NotImplementedError`. Reproduced in [`LangCy::to_currency`].
//! 9. **The int branch says `"minws "`, not `"meinws "`.** CY's own
//!    `MINUS_PREFIX_WORD` is `"meinws "` and `to_cardinal` hardcodes
//!    `("meinws", None)`, but `to_currency` spells the negative prefix
//!    `"minws "`. A typo, kept verbatim: `to_currency(-1)` is `"minws un bunt"`.
//! 10. **The unit words in the int branch are pre-mutated literals.**
//!     `"bunt"` / `"bunnoedd"` are the soft-mutated forms of `punt`/`punnoedd`,
//!     hardcoded as strings rather than produced by [`softmutation`] — so the
//!     mutation fires even when nothing precedes it that would trigger one
//!     (`"dim bunnoedd"` after "dim", which triggers no mutation at all).
//! 11. **`_cents_verbose(1, ...)` drops the numeral.** The `number > 1` guard
//!     sends 1 to `m = [(OBJ, None)]`, so `0.01` renders `"... ceiniog ceiniog"`
//!     — the counted noun and `pluralize`'s singular, with no "un".
//! 12. **`_money_verbose` always asks `to_cardinal` for the *feminine* form**,
//!     even for masculine currencies: `2.0 USD` is `"dwy dolar dolar, ..."`.
//!     The dead `if currency in CURRENCIES_FEM` guard is commented out in the
//!     source with the note "always true in this context". `_cents_verbose`, by
//!     contrast, leaves gender at its masculine default.
//! 13. **Every float prints the unit twice.** `_money_verbose` already appends
//!     the currency noun (as `counted=`, or as the `o <plural>` partitive above
//!     100), and then `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` appends `pluralize(left, cr1)`
//!     on top: `"deuddeg euro euros"`, `"mil ... o euros euros"`.
//! 14. **Zero cents leave a double space.** `_cents_verbose(0, ...)` returns
//!     `""`, and Base's `"%s%s %s%s %s %s"` template still emits the spaces
//!     around it: `1.0` → `"un euro euro,  ceiniogau"` (two spaces after the
//!     comma). The `has_decimal` guard keeps the segment alive for `1.0`.
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! * `NotImplementedError` → [`N2WError::NotImplemented`]: `to_ordinal(n)` for
//!   `n > 100`, `to_cardinal(n)` for `abs(n) >= 999 * 10**33`, and a currency
//!   code outside CY's four on the float/cheque paths.
//! * `KeyError` → [`N2WError::Key`]: `to_ordinal(n)` for `n < 0` (bug 7).
//! * `AttributeError` → [`N2WError::Attribute`]: `to_currency(<negative float>)`
//!   for a *known* code — the missing `self.negword` (bug 8's sibling). A
//!   negative float with an *unknown* code raises `NotImplementedError` instead,
//!   because Base looks `CURRENCY_FORMS` up before it touches `negword`.
