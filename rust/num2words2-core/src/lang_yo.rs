//! Port of `lang_YO.py` (Yoruba).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_YO` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so Python's
//! `Num2Word_Base.__init__` never enters the `if any(hasattr(...))` branch:
//! `self.cards` is never built and `self.MAXVAL` is never set. `to_cardinal`
//! is overridden outright and drives a recursive `_int_to_word`. Accordingly
//! `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and there is
//! **no overflow check** — no input can raise `OverflowError`, because
//! `_int_to_word` has a `str(number)` fallback instead of a ceiling (bug 1).
//!
//! `setup()` supplies `negword = "minus "` (note the trailing space) and
//! `pointword = "point"`. Every in-scope entry point is overridden by
//! `Num2Word_YO`, so nothing is inherited from `Num2Word_Base` except the
//! attributes above:
//!   * `to_cardinal`    — overridden (see below)
//!   * `to_ordinal`     — overridden: `to_cardinal(n) + "-kẹta"`
//!   * `to_ordinal_num` — overridden: `str(n) + "."`
//!   * `to_year`        — overridden: `to_cardinal(val)`, ignoring `longval`
//!
//! No cross-call mutable state: `Num2Word_YO` defines no `str_to_number` and
//! stashes no flags between methods, so the stateless Rust path is faithful.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs / oddities
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. All of the following look wrong but are
//! exactly what Python emits, verified against the frozen corpus:
//!
//! 1. **`_int_to_word` gives up at 10^9 and returns the bare digits.** The
//!    final `else` is `return str(number)`, so `to_cardinal(10**9)` ==
//!    `"1000000000"` — digits, not words — and `to_ordinal(10**9)` ==
//!    `"1000000000-kẹta"`. There is no `million`-and-up table (`setup` stops
//!    at `self.million`), and no exception is ever raised. The fallback keeps
//!    full precision for arbitrarily large input, hence the `BigInt`
//!    `to_string()` in [`LangYo::int_to_word`] — the corpus exercises 10^21.
//!    Because `to_cardinal` strips the sign *before* recursing, a large
//!    negative renders as `"minus 1000000000"`.
//!
//! 2. **Hundreds are formed as `ones[h] + " " + hundred`,** so 100 is
//!    `"ọkan ọgọrun"` ("one hundred") rather than a bare `"ọgọrun"`. Kept.
//!
//! 3. **`to_ordinal` appends a fixed `"-kẹta"` to the cardinal** — `kẹta` is
//!    the Yoruba ordinal for *third*, so every ordinal literally reads
//!    "<n>-third": `to_ordinal(1)` == `"ọkan-kẹta"`, `to_ordinal(0)` ==
//!    `"zero-kẹta"`. It is a fixed suffix, not agreement, and unlike most
//!    modules it neither rejects 0 nor rejects negatives:
//!    `to_ordinal(-1)` == `"minus ọkan-kẹta"`. No exception path exists.
//!
//! 4. **`_int_to_word(0)` is written `self.ones[0] if self.ones[0] else "zero"`.**
//!    `ones[0]` is `""` — falsy — so the conditional always takes the `else`
//!    and returns the English `"zero"`. The `ones[0]` arm is unreachable dead
//!    code; modelled here as the constant [`ZERO`].
//!
//! 5. **The `number < 0` arm of `_int_to_word` is unreachable** from every
//!    in-scope entry point: `to_cardinal` strips the leading `"-"` from the
//!    *string* and prepends `negword` itself, so `_int_to_word` only ever
//!    sees a non-negative value. It is reproduced anyway (see
//!    [`LangYo::int_to_word`]) because it is part of the function's
//!    semantics, and it would double the negword if it ever were reached.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `Num2Word_YO` overrides `to_currency` **wholesale** — it never reaches
//! `Num2Word_Base.to_currency`, so none of `parse_currency_parts`,
//! `pluralize`, `_cents_verbose`, `_cents_terse` or `CURRENCY_PRECISION`
//! participate. It re-derives the split itself from `str(val)`. See
//! [`LangYo::to_currency`].
//!
//! `to_cheque` is *not* overridden, so it comes from `Num2Word_Base` via the
//! trait default (`currency::default_to_cheque`), which needs only
//! [`Lang::currency_forms`] + [`Lang::lang_name`] + the default
//! `money_verbose` (= `to_cardinal`) from this file.
//!
//! `CURRENCY_FORMS` is defined directly on `Num2Word_YO` (NGN, USD, EUR) and
//! is **not** the shared `Num2Word_EUR` dict, so the `lang_EN` mutation trap
//! described in `PORTING_CURRENCY.md` does not apply here — Yoruba never sees
//! EN's ~24 extra codes. `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` and `CURRENCY_PRECISION` are
//! inherited from `Num2Word_Base` and are both `{}`, so the trait defaults
//! (`None` / `100`) are already correct and are not overridden. Verified
//! against the live interpreter.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs / oddities — currency
//!
//! 6. **An unknown currency code silently falls back to NGN** rather than
//!    raising. `to_currency` looks the code up with
//!    `CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, list(CURRENCY_FORMS.values())[0])`, and
//!    `values()[0]` is NGN because it is first in the dict literal. So
//!    `to_currency(1, currency="GBP")` == `"ọkan náírà"` — pounds rendered as
//!    naira. The corpus pins this for GBP/JPY/KWD/BHD/INR/CNY/CHF.
//!    `to_cheque` does **not** share the fallback: it indexes
//!    `CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` and raises `NotImplementedError`. Hence
//!    [`Lang::currency_forms`] here reports the honest `None` for a missing
//!    code (so cheque raises) and the NGN fallback lives *only* inside
//!    [`LangYo::to_currency`], exactly mirroring the two Python call sites.
//!
//! 7. **Cents are truncated to 2 digits, never rounded.** The subunit comes
//!    from `int(parts[1][:2].ljust(2, "0"))` — a *string* slice of `str(val)`.
//!    So `2.675` -> 67 cents (not 68; there is no ROUND_HALF_UP anywhere),
//!    `1.005` -> 0 cents, and `0.0001` -> `"zero euros"`. Conversely `1.5`
//!    -> `"5"` -> ljust -> `"50"` -> 50 cents, i.e. the slice is positional,
//!    not numeric.
//!
//! 8. **`CURRENCY_PRECISION` is ignored entirely.** JPY (0-decimal) and
//!    KWD/BHD (3-decimal) are not in `CURRENCY_FORMS` anyway, so they take
//!    the NGN fallback *and* the hardcoded 2-digit cent slice: `to_currency
//!    (12.34, currency="JPY")` == `"mẹwa méjì náírà ọgbọn mẹrin kóbò"` —
//!    yen with naira subunits. Both corpus-pinned.
//!
//! 9. **`adjective` is accepted and then ignored.** `Num2Word_YO.to_currency`
//!    never reads it (and `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` is empty regardless), so
//!    `adjective=True` changes nothing.
//!
//! 10. **`cents=False` drops the subunit clause entirely.** Python's guard is
//!    `if cents and right:`. In `Num2Word_Base` `cents=False` means "render
//!    the subunit as digits" (`_cents_terse`); here it means "omit". So
//!    `to_currency(12.34, cents=False)` == `"mẹwa méjì euros"`.
//!
//! 11. **A float whose `repr` is scientific crashes or silently mis-reads.**
//!    Because the split is done on `str(val)` rather than on the number,
//!    `str(1e16)` == `"1e+16"` reaches `int()` and raises `ValueError`, while
//!    `str(1.25e16)` == `"1.25e+16"` splits into `"1"` / `"25e+16"`, whose
//!    first two chars are `"25"` — so `1.25e16` renders as
//!    `"ọkan euro ogún marun cents"` (one euro, twenty-five cents). See
//!    [`py_str`] for how this is reproduced.
//!
//! 12. **The `separator` default is `" "`, not Base's `","`.** Python's
//!    signature is `to_currency(self, val, currency="NGN", cents=True,
//!    separator=" ", adjective=False)`, so the corpus — which never passes
//!    `separator=` — records `"mẹwa méjì euros ọgbọn mẹrin cents"` rather than
//!    `"...euros,ọgbọn..."`. Not a bug so much as a divergence from Base that
//!    is easy to lose: [`Lang::default_separator`] carries it, and
//!    `to_currency` receives `None` when the caller omitted the kwarg.
//!
//! # Float/Decimal cardinal
//!
//! `Num2Word_YO.to_cardinal` handles non-integers inline: it never calls
//! `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal_float`, never runs `float2tuple`, and does **no
//! arithmetic at all** — the whole algorithm is string surgery on
//! `str(number)`:
//!
//! ```python
//! n = str(number).strip()
//! if n.startswith("-"): n = n[1:]; ret = self.negword
//! if "." in n:
//!     left, right = n.split(".", 1)
//!     ret += self._int_to_word(int(left)) + " " + self.pointword + " "
//!     for digit in right:
//!         ret += self._int_to_word(int(digit)) + " "
//!     return ret.strip()
//! ```
//!
//! So [`LangYo::to_cardinal_float`] reconstructs the text Python saw —
//! `repr(float)` via the same [`py_str`] the currency port already uses, and
//! `str(Decimal)` via [`decimal_str_abs`] — then runs the string algorithm.
//! The base-path traps (banker's rounding, the `< 0.01` float2tuple rescue)
//! do not apply here: for Yoruba the decimal *string* is the spec, so `2.675`
//! reads its repr digits verbatim (`"méjì point mẹfa meje marun"`) and `1.005`
//! keeps its leading zeros (`"ọkan point zero zero marun"`).
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs / oddities — float cardinal
//!
//! 13. **A scientific-notation repr raises ValueError**, same family as
//!     bug 11: `str(1e-05)` == `"1e-05"` has no `"."`, so the whole literal
//!     hits `int()` — `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1e-05'` —
//!     while `str(1.5e-05)` == `"1.5e-05"` *does* split, and the digit loop
//!     dies on the `'e'` (`... base 10: 'e'`). Decimals keep their own
//!     spelling: `Decimal("1E-7")` fails on `'1E-7'`, `Decimal("1.5E-7")` on
//!     `'E'` (capital, unpadded — Decimal's `__str__`, not float `repr`).
//!     All four messages verified against the live interpreter.
//!
//! 14. **The `precision=` kwarg is a no-op.** The dispatcher sets
//!     `converter.precision` (the attribute exists, inherited from Base), but
//!     `Num2Word_YO.to_cardinal` never reads it — the digit count comes from
//!     the text. Base-path languages honour it; Yoruba ignores it, so
//!     `precision_override` is deliberately discarded. Verified live:
//!     `to_cardinal(3.14)` with `precision=5` is still
//!     `"mẹta point ọkan mẹrin"`.
//!
//! 15. **A whole float keeps its fractional clause**: `repr(1.0)` is `"1.0"`,
//!     so Python renders `"ọkan point zero"`, never bare `"ọkan"` (corpus rows
//!     `0.0`/`1.0` pin this). The dispatcher routes whole floats to the Python
//!     converter, so the Rust hook only ever *receives* non-whole values — but
//!     the reconstruction appends `repr`'s `".0"` anyway, so both sides agree
//!     even on a direct call.
//!
//! 16. **Float noise is spelled out digit by digit.** There is no rounding
//!     rescue anywhere, so `0.30000000000000004` becomes `"zero point mẹta"`
//!     followed by fifteen `"zero"`s and a `"mẹrin"` — 17 fraction words,
//!     exactly the repr digits. Similarly the `>= 10**9` fallback (bug 1)
//!     applies to the integer part: `Decimal("98746251323029.99")` is
//!     `"98746251323029 point mẹsan mẹsan"` (corpus-pinned).
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! The four integer modes raise nothing: there is no overflow ceiling
//! (bug 1), no ordinal guard (bug 3), and no dict/list lookup that can miss —
//! every index into `ones`/`tens` is derived from `n // 10 % 10` and is in
//! range by construction. All four modes are total over the integers.
//!
//! The currency and float surfaces add exactly two:
//!
//! * `N2WError::Value` — `to_currency` or the float cardinal on a value whose
//!   `str()` is scientific notation, where Python's `int()` chokes on the
//!   literal (bugs 11 and 13).
//! * `N2WError::NotImplemented` — `to_cheque` with a code outside
//!   {NGN, USD, EUR}, raised by the inherited `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque`.
//!   `to_currency` never raises this (bug 6).

/// bug 11) is a property of that text. So the faithful port reconstructs the
/// text and then runs Python's algorithm on it, rather than re-deriving the
/// split numerically and hoping the edge cases agree.
///
/// # Why it is not a `repr(float)` reimplementation
///
/// `currency.rs` deliberately keeps shortest-round-trip float formatting on
/// the Python side, and this does not bring it back. The *digits* arrive
/// already chosen: the shim sent `str(value)`, and `bigdecimal`'s parser
/// stores them verbatim as `(int_val, scale)` without normalising, so
/// `as_bigint_and_exponent()` hands back exactly the digits `repr` produced.
/// All that is recovered here is the **layout** — where `repr` put the point,
/// and whether it chose exponential form — which is a plain range check on the
/// decimal exponent, not a formatting algorithm.
///
/// `decpt` is the decimal point's position relative to the digit string
/// (`value == 0.<digits> * 10^decpt`). CPython's `float_repr` emits fixed
/// notation for `-4 < decpt <= 16` and exponential outside it, which is why
/// `str(1e15)` is `"1000000000000000.0"` but `str(1e16)` is `"1e+16"`, and
/// `str(1e-4)` is `"0.0001"` but `str(1e-5)` is `"1e-05"`. Verified against
/// the interpreter across that whole boundary.
///
/// # Limits
///
/// `digits` must be the **absolute** value: Python evaluates `val = abs(val)`
/// before `str(val)`, so a negative never reaches the text. (`-0.0` is the one
/// exception — `-0.0 < 0` is `False`, so Python stringifies `"-0.0"` and
/// `int("-0")` yields `0`. `bigdecimal` has no signed zero, so this returns
/// `"0.0"` and `int("0")` yields the same `0`. Indistinguishable in output.)
///

/// `{1.0, 1.25, 9.99, 5.0, 1.5} x 10^{-12..23}` that straddles both
/// notation boundaries in both directions: zero mismatches.
///
/// `decimal.Decimal` — which `num2words()` also accepts (`__init__.py` admits
/// `(int, float, Decimal)` and sends `str(number)`) — formats itself by

/// | `Decimal("1e-5")`    | `"zero euros"` | ValueError |
/// | `Decimal("1E+2")`    | ValueError     | `"ọkan ọgọrun euros"` |
///
/// The first two are **not fixable here, even in principle**:
/// `Decimal("0.00001")` and the float `1e-05` both parse to exactly
