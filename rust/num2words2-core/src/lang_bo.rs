//! Port of `lang_BO.py` (Tibetan).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_BO` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so Python's
//! `Num2Word_Base.__init__` never builds `self.cards` and never sets
//! `MAXVAL`. `to_cardinal` is overridden outright and drives a recursive
//! `_int_to_word`. Consequently `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait
//! defaults here, and there is **no overflow check and no ceiling at all** —
//! the top branch of `_int_to_word` recurses on `number // 10**8`
//! indefinitely, stacking "དུང་ཕྱུར་" once per 10^8 factor. `to_cardinal(10**21)`
//! is therefore "གཅིག་འབུམ་དུང་ཕྱུར་དུང་ཕྱུར་", not an `OverflowError`.
//!
//! `setup()` sets `negword = "མེད་ཆ་ "` (note the **trailing ASCII space**, which
//! is part of the literal) and `pointword = "ཚེག་"`.
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` but overridden by BO, so the trait defaults
//! are *not* used for any of the four in-scope modes:
//!   * `to_cardinal` — own algorithm (below).
//!   * `to_ordinal(n)` → `to_cardinal(n) + "པ་"`.
//!   * `to_ordinal_num(n)` → `str(n) + "པ"` (BO overrides the base, which
//!     returns the value unchanged).
//!   * `to_year(n)` → `"སྤྱི་ལོ་" + to_cardinal(n)` (BO overrides the base, which
//!     delegates to `to_cardinal`).
//!
//! # Behaviour worth flagging (reproduced verbatim, not fixed)
//!
//! 1. **No `verify_ordinal` call.** `Num2Word_Base.to_ordinal` would normally
//!    be guarded by `verify_ordinal`, which raises `TypeError` on negatives.
//!    BO's override skips it entirely, so `to_ordinal(-1000000)` happily
//!    returns "མེད་ཆ་ གཅིག་ས་ཡ་པ་" — the negative-marker prefix with an ordinal
//!    suffix glued on. Confirmed against the frozen corpus.
//! 2. **`to_year` prepends its era marker *outside* the sign.** Because
//!    `to_year` is `"སྤྱི་ལོ་" + self.to_cardinal(val)` and `to_cardinal` emits the
//!    negword itself, a negative year reads "སྤྱི་ལོ་" then "མེད་ཆ་ " — i.e.
//!    `to_year(-500)` == "སྤྱི་ལོ་མེད་ཆ་ ལྔ་བརྒྱ་", with the era word preceding the
//!    minus marker. Confirmed against the frozen corpus.
//! 3. **Asymmetric multiplier handling.** The `< 1000` branch indexes `ones`
//!    directly (`ones[number // 100]`) while every branch above it recurses
//!    (`self._int_to_word(number // 1000)` etc.). This is why 100 is
//!    "གཅིག་བརྒྱ་" (an explicit "one hundred") and why the >= 10^8 branch can
//!    nest "དུང་ཕྱུར་" arbitrarily deep.
//! 4. **`negword` is used raw, not stripped.** BO's `to_cardinal` does
//!    `ret = self.negword` where `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal` would do
//!    `"%s " % self.negword.strip()`. Both happen to yield "མེད་ཆ་ " here
//!    because the literal already carries exactly one trailing space, but the
//!    literal is what is reproduced below.
//!
//! # The float / Decimal path
//!
//! BO does **not** override `to_cardinal_float`; it overrides `to_cardinal`
//! and handles non-integers inline. So `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal_float` —
//! and with it `float2tuple` — is **never reached**, and none of that
//! machinery applies here:
//!
//! * **No `float2tuple`, so no f64 artefacts to preserve.** The base class
//!   computes `post = abs(value - pre) * 10**precision` in binary f64 and
//!   leans on a `< 0.01` heuristic to rescue `2.675` from `674.9999999999998`.
//!   BO never does any float arithmetic at all: it reads the *digits of
//!   `str(number)`*. `2.675` is "two point six seven five" because the
//!   characters `6`, `7`, `5` are literally in `repr(2.675)`, not because a
//!   rounding heuristic recovered them. `1.005` likewise.
//! * **No `round()`, so no banker's-rounding trap.** There is no rounding
//!   anywhere on this path.
//! * **`self.precision` is never read**, so the `precision=` kwarg (issue
//!   #580) is inert: `num2words(2.675, lang="bo", precision=1)` still emits
//!   all three fractional digits. `precision_override` is accordingly ignored
//!   — see [`LangBo::to_cardinal_float`].
//!
//! What the path *does* need is `str(number)`, byte for byte, because every
//! branch keys off it: the `"-"` prefix, the `"."`, and one word per
//! character of the fractional part. That makes the two `FloatValue` arms
//! genuinely different functions — `repr(float)` and `Decimal.__str__` are
//! separate CPython routines with separate exponent-notation rules — so
//! [`python_float_repr`] and [`python_decimal_str`] reproduce them
//! separately. Both are reconstructions, and their limits are documented on
//! each.
//!
//! Trailing zeros are the clearest proof that this is a string path rather
//! than a numeric one: `Decimal("1.10")` renders as "one point one zero"
//! because `str()` kept the zero, while `1.10` as a *float* renders as "one
//! point one" because `repr()` dropped it. A numeric port collapses the two.
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! For the four integer modes: none. Every in-scope path is total for integer
//! input: `_int_to_word` only ever indexes `ones`/`tens` with a value it has
//! already bounded to 0..=9, and the sign is stripped before recursion begins,
//! so no `IndexError`, `KeyError` or `ValueError` site exists. There is no
//! `MAXVAL`, hence no `OverflowError` either.
//!
//! The currency surface adds two, both detailed below: `NotImplementedError`
//! from `to_cheque` on an unknown code, and `ValueError` from `_split_currency`
//! when `str(val)` came out in exponent notation.
//!
//! The float path adds one more, for the same underlying reason: `int()` is
//! fed raw characters of `str(number)`, so any value whose `str()` went
//! scientific raises **`ValueError`** rather than converting. See
//! [`int_token`].
//!
//! # The currency surface
//!
//! `Num2Word_BO` declares `CURRENCY_FORMS` for exactly three codes (CNY, USD,
//! EUR) and overrides `to_currency` outright. It inherits `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`
//! and `CURRENCY_PRECISION` from `Num2Word_Base`, where **both are empty** — so
//! `CURRENCY_PRECISION.get(code, 100)` is 100 for *every* code and the trait
//! defaults for `currency_precision`/`currency_adjective` are already correct.
//! This is why BO has no 3-decimal or 0-decimal behaviour: `to_currency("KWD")`
//! divides by 100, not 1000, and `to_currency("JPY", 12.34)` still renders a
//! cents segment rather than rounding to a whole unit. Confirmed against the
//! frozen corpus for both codes.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is *not* overridden, so `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque` runs verbatim
//! — which means the two halves of the surface disagree about unknown codes:
//!
//! * `to_currency` does `CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, CURRENCY_FORMS["CNY"])`
//!   and so **silently falls back to CNY** — `to_currency(1, currency="GBP")`
//!   is "གཅིག་ སྒོར་", never an error.
//! * `to_cheque` does `CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` and so raises
//!   `NotImplementedError` for the very same code.
//!
//! Both are reproduced: [`LangBo::to_currency`] resolves the fallback itself,
//! while `currency_forms` returns `None` for an unknown code so that the
//! trait's default `to_cheque` (== `default_to_cheque`, a faithful port of the
//! base method) raises. Corpus: `currency:GBP` succeeds with CNY words,
//! `cheque:GBP` raises `NotImplementedError`.
//!
//! ## `parse_currency` does not exist
//!
//! `Num2Word_BO.to_currency` opens with
//!
//! ```text
//! try:
//!     left, right, is_negative = self.parse_currency(val)
//! except AttributeError:
//!     ...
//! ```
//!
//! No `parse_currency` method is defined anywhere in num2words2 — not on
//! `Num2Word_BO`, not on `Num2Word_Base` (`currency.py` exports the free
//! function `parse_currency_parts`, which is a different name and never bound
//! to the instance). The attribute lookup therefore *always* raises
//! `AttributeError`, the `try` body never completes, and the `except` branch is
//! the only live path. It is ported as straight-line code with no error plumbing,
//! because the exception is unconditional and always swallowed.

///   `isinstance(val, int)` distinction the boundary preserves.
///
/// * **`CurrencyValue::Decimal`** — the `BigDecimal` was parsed from the exact
///   `str(value)` the Python side produced, so its digits *are* the characters
///   Python split on. For any plain-decimal `str()`, Python's
///   `int(parts[1][:2].ljust(2, "0"))` — take the first two fractional digits,
///   right-pad with zeros — is exactly `floor(frac * 100)`, which is what the
///   truncating arithmetic below computes:
///
///   | `str(n)` | `parts[1][:2].ljust(2,"0")` | `right` | `floor(frac*100)` |
///   |---|---|---|---|
///   | `"12.34"` | `"34"` | 34 | 34 |

///   | `"1.0"`   | `"00"` | 0  | 0 |
///   | `"0.001"` | `"00"` | 0  | 0 |
///   | `"0.567"` | `"56"` | 56 | 56 |
///
///   The `ljust` and the `[:2]` truncation are both subsumed: `BigDecimal`
///   carries the trailing zeros of `"1.0"` in its scale, and `with_scale(0)`
///   truncates rather than rounds (`99.99 -> 99`), matching `[:2]` discarding
///   the third digit instead of rounding on it.
///
/// # The exponent-notation `ValueError`
///
/// `str()` switches to exponent notation for a float outside roughly
/// `1e-4 <= |v| < 1e16`, and `int()` chokes on the resulting token:
/// `str(1e16)` is `"1e+16"`, `parts` is `["1e+16"]`, and `int("1e+16")` raises
/// **`ValueError`**. (`str(1.5e16)` is `"1.5e+16"`, where `parts[1][:2]` is
/// `"5e"` and `int("5e")` raises `ValueError` too — same exception, different
/// token.) So the whole function raises for large floats rather than returning
/// anything.
///
/// The check below keys off the *representation*, which is the same thing
/// Python's `str().split(".")` does, so it stays faithful for `Decimal` inputs
/// too (the shim accepts those alongside floats): `Decimal("1E+16")` stringifies
/// with an exponent and raises, while `Decimal(10**16)` stringifies as plain
/// digits and succeeds — and the two parse to different scales here (-16 vs 0),
/// so both are handled correctly.
///
/// A **positive** exponent is therefore recoverable: plain decimal notation can
/// never yield a negative `BigDecimal` scale, so `scale < 0` proves `str()`
/// emitted an exponent, and the `ValueError` is raised here. Verified against
/// CPython: the message matches `int("1e+16")`'s byte for byte.
///
/// A **negative** exponent is not recoverable, and this is the one known gap.
/// `str(1e-05)` is `"1e-05"` (CPython goes scientific below `1e-4`) and raises,
/// but it parses to the very same `(1, scale=5)` as `Decimal("0.00001")`, which
/// stringifies as `"0.00001"` and does *not* raise. The two are indistinguishable
/// once across the boundary, so a float `< 1e-4` silently returns `(0, 0)` here
/// where Python raises `ValueError`. Discriminating on the value instead
/// (`|v| < 1e-4`) would fix the float and break the `Decimal`, so the
/// representation-faithful rule is kept and the gap is flagged in the report
/// rather than papered over. Reproducing it properly needs `repr(float)`, which

    ///
    /// 1. **This override never raises `NotImplementedError`.** The `.get`
    ///    fallback means an unknown code renders in CNY words, in flat
    ///    contradiction to the inherited `to_cheque`. `currency:GBP`,
    ///    `currency:JPY`, `currency:KWD`, `currency:BHD`, `currency:INR` and
    ///    `currency:CHF` all come out as CNY in the corpus.
    /// 2. **A float with zero cents drops the cents segment.** `cents_str` is
    ///    gated on `right` being *truthy*, so `1.0` — which `_split_currency`
    ///    reduces to `right = 0` — renders "གཅིག་ ཡུ་རོ་", with no cents at all.
    ///    `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` would emit "... and zero cents" here; BO
    ///    does not, and the int/float distinction is invisible in its output.
    ///    Both `1` and `1.0` give "གཅིག་ ཡུ་རོ་". The distinction is still
    ///    threaded through faithfully (see [`split_currency`]) because it is
    ///    load-bearing everywhere else and only *coincidentally* collapses here.
    /// 3. **`cents=False` omits the cents instead of making them terse.** The
    ///    base class switches to `_cents_terse` (digits); BO's `cents and right`
    ///    guard just suppresses the whole segment, so `_cents_terse` is
    ///    unreachable and the trait default is left alone.
    /// 4. **`adjective` is accepted and completely ignored.** BO declares the
    ///    parameter, never reads it, and inherits an empty `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`
    ///    anyway — hence `_adjective` below and no `currency_adjective` override.
    /// 5. **`negword` is used raw, not stripped.** `self.negword + result`,
    ///    where the base would do `"%s " % self.negword.strip()`. Both give
    ///    "མེད་ཆ་ " because the literal already ends in exactly one space.
