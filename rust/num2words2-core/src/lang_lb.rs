//! Port of `lang_LB.py` (Luxembourgish).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_LB` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, and
//! `Num2Word_Base` declares none at class level either. The `hasattr` guard in
//! `Num2Word_Base.__init__` therefore never fires, so Python never builds
//! `self.cards` and never sets `MAXVAL`. `to_cardinal` is overridden outright
//! and drives `_int_to_word`, a plain recursive descent over the
//! ones/tens/hundred/thousand/million scale.
//!
//! Consequently `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and
//! there is **no overflow check at all** — see bug 5 below for what happens
//! instead of an `OverflowError`.
//!
//! `setup()` only assigns `negword`/`pointword`/`ones`/`tens`/`hundred`/
//! `thousand`/`million`; those are the whole of the language data.
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` — but note LB overrides `to_year` itself:
//!   * `to_year(val, longval=True) -> self.to_cardinal(val)` — LB's own
//!     override, which discards `longval` and ignores the elaborate
//!     century/"hundred"-splitting logic in `Num2Word_Base.to_year`. Years are
//!     therefore plain cardinals: `to_year(1999)` == "eent dausend néng honnert
//!     nongzeg néng", **not** a "nineteen ninety-nine"-style reading.
//!   * `to_ordinal_num` is overridden by LB as `str(number) + "."`.
//!
//! No cross-call mutable state: every method here is a pure function of its
//! argument. There is no `str_to_number`/`_pending_ordinal`-style handshake.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. Everything below looks wrong and is exactly
//! what Python emits — each one is confirmed against the frozen corpus.
//!
//! 1. **`to_cardinal(0)` == "zero"**, an English word, in a Luxembourgish
//!    converter (correct would be "null"). `_int_to_word` opens with
//!    `return self.ones[0] if self.ones[0] else "zero"`. `self.ones[0]` is the
//!    empty string — a placeholder so that `ones[n]` can be indexed by digit —
//!    and `""` is falsy, so the conditional *always* takes the "zero" branch.
//!    The `self.ones[0]` arm is dead code. Modelled by the unconditional
//!    [`ZERO`] return in [`LangLb::int_to_word`].
//! 2. **There are no teens.** `tens[1]` is "zéng" (10) and 11..=19 are built by
//!    the generic `tens[n/10] + " " + ones[n%10]` rule, so `to_cardinal(11)` ==
//!    "zéng eent" ("ten one") rather than "eelef", and `to_cardinal(19)` ==
//!    "zéng néng". This propagates: `to_cardinal(12345)` == "zéng zwou dausend
//!    dräi honnert véierzeg fënnef", because the thousands part 12 is itself
//!    rendered "zéng zwou".
//! 3. **Hundreds/thousands/millions are never elided or joined.** Python emits
//!    `ones[h] + " " + hundred` unconditionally, so 100 == "eent honnert"
//!    ("one hundred", where idiomatic Luxembourgish is "honnert"), 1000 ==
//!    "eent dausend", 10^6 == "eent Millioun". Every scale word is
//!    space-separated rather than compounded, which is not how Luxembourgish
//!    writes numbers.
//! 4. **"zwou" is the feminine form of 2**, used unconditionally — so 2, 200
//!    ("zwou honnert") and 2000 ("zwou dausend") all take the feminine, and the
//!    masculine "zwee" never appears. Likewise "eent" is the neuter/counting
//!    form used even attributively ("eent honnert").
//! 5. **Values >= 10^9 silently degrade to digits** instead of raising.
//!    `_int_to_word`'s final `else` is `return str(number)  # Fallback for very
//!    large numbers`. So `to_cardinal(10**9)` == "1000000000" and
//!    `to_cardinal(10**21)` == "1000000000000000000000" — a *successful* call
//!    returning an unconverted numeral, not an `OverflowError`. "Milliard" and
//!    everything above it are simply absent from the language data. The scale
//!    words stop at `million` = "Millioun", so 999999999 is the largest value
//!    that produces words. This also means the fallback composes with the sign:
//!    `to_cardinal(-10**12)` == "minus 1000000000000".
//! 6. **`to_ordinal` is a blind suffix append**, `to_cardinal(n) + "-ten"`,
//!    with no stem change, no agreement and no special-casing whatsoever. It
//!    inherits every quirk above and adds its own:
//!      * `to_ordinal(0)` == "zero-ten" (bug 1 leaks through).
//!      * `to_ordinal(-1)` == "minus eent-ten" — negatives are cheerfully
//!        ordinalised, where most modules raise
//!        "Cannot treat negative num %s as ordinal".
//!      * `to_ordinal(10**12)` == "1000000000000-ten" — bug 5 leaks through,
//!        yielding digits with a Luxembourgish suffix glued on.
//!      * The suffix attaches to the *last word only* with no separator, so
//!        `to_ordinal(999)` == "néng honnert nongzeg néng-ten".
//!    Real Luxembourgish ordinals are "éischten", "zweeten", "drëtten", …;
//!    none of that is implemented.
//! 7. **`to_ordinal_num` ignores the sign**: `str(number) + "."` gives
//!    `to_ordinal_num(-1)` == "-1.", a negative ordinal numeral.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `Num2Word_LB` declares its own `CURRENCY_FORMS` — only `EUR` and `USD` —
//! and overrides `to_currency` wholesale. It subclasses `Num2Word_Base`, **not**
//! `Num2Word_EUR`, so the class dict that `Num2Word_EN.__init__` mutates in
//! place (rewriting EUR to `("euro", "euros")` and adding ~24 codes) is a
//! *different* dict and never reaches here. The literal in `lang_LB.py` is what
//! runs, verified against the live interpreter:
//!
//! ```text
//! {'EUR': (('euro', 'euro'), ('cent', 'cents')),
//!  'USD': (('dollar', 'dollars'), ('cent', 'cents'))}
//! ```
//!
//! Hence `to_currency(2)` == "zwou euro", not "zwou euros" — EUR's plural form
//! is spelled identically to its singular in LB's own table.
//!
//! `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` and `CURRENCY_PRECISION` are both inherited from
//! `Num2Word_Base` and are both `{}`, so `currency_adjective` stays `None` and
//! `currency_precision` stays at the trait's default 100 for *every* code.
//! `pluralize`, `_money_verbose`, `_cents_verbose` and `_cents_terse` are all
//! inherited untouched; LB's `to_currency` calls **none** of them, so only
//! `_money_verbose` is ever reached, and only via the inherited `to_cheque`.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is **not** overridden by LB, so `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque` runs
//! unchanged and the trait default in `currency.rs` serves it. It needs nothing
//! from this file beyond [`Lang::lang_name`] and [`Lang::currency_forms`].
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs, currency edition
//!
//! 8. **An unknown currency code silently becomes EUR.** `to_currency` looks up
//!    `self.CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, list(self.CURRENCY_FORMS.values())[0])`
//!    — a `.get` with the *first dict value* as its default, not a `[]`. So
//!    `to_currency(0.5, currency="JPY")` == "zero euro fofzeg cents" and
//!    `to_currency(12.34, currency="KWD")` == "zéng zwou euro drësseg véier
//!    cents": every unimplemented code renders as euro, and no code ever raises
//!    from `to_currency`. The corpus records this for GBP, JPY, KWD, BHD, INR,
//!    CNY and CHF alike. Python's reliance on dict insertion order to mean
//!    "EUR" is modelled by the explicit [`LangLb::fallback_forms`] field.
//! 9. **`to_cheque` disagrees with `to_currency` about the same code.** The
//!    inherited `to_cheque` does a strict `self.CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` inside
//!    a `try/except KeyError` and re-raises `NotImplementedError`. So `GBP`
//!    *raises* on the cheque surface while rendering happily as euro on the
//!    currency surface. Both behaviours are real and both are in the corpus.
//! 10. **Cents are truncated to two digits, never rounded.** `parts[1][:2]`
//!    slices the fractional *string*: `1.005` -> parts[1] "005" -> "00" -> 0
//!    cents -> "eent euro", and `12.345` -> "34" -> "drësseg véier cents".
//!    Nothing here rounds, so 1.005 loses its half-cent instead of becoming 1
//!    cent.
//! 11. **`CURRENCY_PRECISION` is never consulted by `to_currency`.** The
//!    divisor is hard-wired to 100 by the `[:2].ljust(2, "0")` slice. JPY (a
//!    zero-decimal currency) therefore gets cents, and KWD/BHD (three-decimal)
//!    get two — though bug 8 means both render as euro anyway.
//! 12. **`adjective` is accepted and completely ignored.** LB's signature takes
//!    it, then never reads it. Modelled by the `_adjective` binding.
//! 13. **`cents=False` drops the cents segment entirely.** `if cents and right`
//!    gates the whole clause, where `Num2Word_Base` would fall through to
//!    `_cents_terse` and emit digits. `to_currency(12.34, cents=False)` ==
//!    "zéng zwou euro" — the 34 cents are gone, not abbreviated.
//! 14. **Zero cents suppress the segment even for a float.** `right` is `0`,
//!    which is falsy, so `1.0` renders "eent euro" with no "zero cents" tail —
//!    the same string a true `int` 1 produces. LB never calls
//!    `isinstance(val, int)`, so unlike every `Num2Word_Base` descendant the
//!    int/float split is invisible here. [`CurrencyValue`]'s two arms are still
//!    handled separately because the *stringification* differs.
//! 15. **The singular/plural choice reads the integer part only.** `cr1[1] if
//!    left != 1 else cr1[0]`, so `1.5` takes the singular ("eent euro"-style
//!    agreement) while the cents clause tests `right != 1` independently.
//!
//! # Float/Decimal entry routing (the `"." in str(number)` rule)
//!
//! `to_cardinal` never asks whether the value is *whole* — it asks whether
//! the *string* shows a point. That routing is reproduced by
//! [`Lang::cardinal_float_entry`] here (and, through it, the ordinal/year
//! entries), with these pinned consequences:
//!
//! 16. **Whole floats keep their ".0" tail.** `str(5.0)` == "5.0" has a
//!     point, so `to_cardinal(5.0)` == "fënnef point zero", *not* "fënnef".
//!     Likewise `Decimal("5.00")` == "fënnef point zero zero" — every
//!     fractional character is spelled via `_int_to_word(int(digit))`,
//!     trailing zeros included (each '0' is "zero", bug 1 again).
//! 17. **`-0.0` renders the negword.** The sign is read off the string
//!     (`str(-0.0)` == "-0.0" starts with "-"), so `to_cardinal(-0.0)` ==
//!     "minus zero point zero". A `< 0` test would miss it.
//! 18. **Scientific notation is a `ValueError`.** `str(1e16)` == "1e+16" has
//!     no point, so Python runs `int("1e+16")` and dies: `invalid literal
//!     for int() with base 10: '1e+16'`. Same for `1e+20`, tiny floats
//!     (`str(1e-05)` == "1e-05") and non-canonical Decimals
//!     (`str(Decimal("1E+2"))` == "1E+2"). The sign is stripped *before* the
//!     `int()` (`n = n[1:]`), so the message never shows a minus.
//! 19. **Point-less integral Decimals take the integer grammar.**
//!     `Decimal("100")` stringifies as "100" — no point — and `int("100")`
//!     succeeds, so it renders "eent honnert" like the int would.
//! 20. `to_ordinal(float)` is `to_cardinal(float) + "-ten"` ("fënnef point
//!     zero-ten"); `to_ordinal_num(float)` is `str(number) + "."` ("5.0.",
//!     "1e+16." — nothing is parsed, so no ValueError there); `to_year(float)`
//!     is `to_cardinal(float)` (the trait default already routes through the
//!     override).
//! 21. **`"Infinity"`/`"NaN"` strings fall back to Python.**
//!     `Decimal("Infinity")` parses fine and dies later in `int("Infinity")`
//!     (ValueError) — but only on the modes that parse;
//!     `to_ordinal_num("Infinity")` happily returns "Infinity.".
//!     `ParsedNumber` cannot carry Inf/NaN into that split, so
//!     `str_to_number` returns NotImplemented and the shim reruns the
//!     original pure-Python path, reproducing every mode exactly.
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! For *integer* input the module cannot raise: there is no overflow check
//! (bug 5 replaces it with a digit fallback), no dict lookup and no `int()`
//! of a hostile token. `to_currency` cannot raise either, because bug 8 turns
//! every missing code into EUR. The errors that do exist:
//!
//! * The `NotImplementedError` that the *inherited* `to_cheque` raises for a
//!   code outside `{EUR, USD}` — `currency.rs`'s `default_to_cheque` already
//!   produces it from [`Lang::currency_forms`] returning `None`.
//! * The `ValueError` of quirk 18 above, on the float/Decimal entries only.
