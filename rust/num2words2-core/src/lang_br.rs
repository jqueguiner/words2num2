//! Port of `lang_BR.py` (Breton).
//!
//! Registry check: `__init__.py` maps `"br"` → `lang_BR.Num2Word_BR()`, so this
//! file ports `Num2Word_BR` — the class the key actually resolves to.
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_BR` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so the `__init__`
//! guard
//!
//! ```python
//! if any(hasattr(self, f) for f in ["high_numwords", "mid_numwords", "low_numwords"]):
//! ```
//!
//! never fires: Python builds **no** `self.cards` and sets **no** `self.MAXVAL`
//! (verified: `hasattr(b, "cards") is False`, `hasattr(b, "MAXVAL") is False`).
//! `to_cardinal` is overridden outright and drives `_int_to_word`, so
//! `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here and **no overflow
//! check exists** — there is no input this module rejects.
//!
//! The Python inheritance chain is exactly `Num2Word_BR` → `Num2Word_Base` →
//! `object`. Every in-scope method is overridden by BR, so nothing is inherited
//! for the four supported modes:
//!   * `to_cardinal`    — overridden (below)
//!   * `to_ordinal`     — overridden: cardinal + `"-vet"`
//!   * `to_ordinal_num` — overridden: `str(number) + "."`
//!   * `to_year`        — overridden: delegates to `to_cardinal`, ignoring the
//!     `longval` keyword entirely
//!
//! # The float / Decimal path
//!
//! BR does **not** override `to_cardinal_float`; it overrides `to_cardinal`,
//! whose very first line is `n = str(number).strip()`. Every float and every
//! `Decimal` therefore reaches the *same* body as an int and is dispatched on
//! whether that string contains a `"."`. `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal_float` and
//! `Num2Word_Base.float2tuple` are inherited but **dead**: BR's `to_cardinal`
//! never calls them, so [`crate::floatpath`] is deliberately not used here.
//!
//! That single fact drives everything below. The digits BR speaks are the
//! digits `repr()` prints — not the ones `float2tuple` derives:
//!
//! ```python
//! if "." in n:
//!     left, right = n.split(".", 1)
//!     ret += self._int_to_word(int(left)) + " " + self.pointword + " "
//!     for digit in right:
//!         ret += self._int_to_word(int(digit)) + " "
//!     return ret.strip()
//! ```
//!
//! ## Further Python quirks reproduced (float / Decimal)
//!
//! 14. **`float2tuple`'s artefact heuristic never runs, and neither does its
//!     rounding.** The `< 0.01` rescue in `base.float2tuple` — the thing that
//!     turns `2.675`'s `674.9999999999998` back into `675` — sits on a code
//!     path BR cannot reach; BR just reads `repr(2.675) == "2.675"` and spells
//!     the characters. There is no `round()` anywhere in this file, so the
//!     banker's-rounding trap does not apply to it either.
//!
//!     The two routes agree on the corpus's headline cases (`1.005` and `2.675`
//!     both come out `"… pemp"`, base by rescuing its artefact and BR by never
//!     creating one), but they are not interchangeable in general: over 30k
//!     random floats they disagree on **8798**. The cheapest witness is a long
//!     fraction, where `post = abs(value - pre) * 10**precision` is evaluated
//!     in f64 and loses the last digit that `repr` kept —
//!     `0.17108284528077355` has `precision == 17`, and that product is
//!     `1.7108284528077356e16`, so `float2tuple` reports `…356` where `repr`
//!     says `…355`. Base ends `"… pemp c'hwec'h"` (6); BR ends `"… pemp pemp"`
//!     (5). `num2words(0.17108284528077355, lang="br")` returns BR's, which is
//!     what makes the string route the observable one and not a detail.
//! 15. **`self.precision` is never read, so `precision=` does nothing.**
//!     `Num2Word_Base.__init__` sets `self.precision = 2` and the dispatcher
//!     happily assigns to it (`hasattr(converter, "precision")` is True), but
//!     BR's `to_cardinal` spells *every* character of `right` regardless.
//!     Verified against the interpreter: `num2words(1.2345, lang="br",
//!     precision=2)` == `num2words(1.2345, lang="br", precision=8)` ==
//!     `"unan point daou tri pevar pemp"` — all four digits, both times. Hence
//!     `precision_override` is accepted and ignored below.
//! 16. **Scientific notation is a `ValueError`, and *which* one depends on the
//!     digit count.** `repr` switches to exponent form at `decpt <= -4` or
//!     `decpt > 16`, and neither `int()` call in the body tolerates it:
//!       * one significant digit (`repr(1e16) == "1e+16"`) has no `"."`, so the
//!         integer branch runs and `int("1e+16")` raises
//!         `invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1e+16'`;
//!       * more than one (`repr(1.5e16) == "1.5e+16"`) *does* have a `"."`, so
//!         the float branch runs, `int("1")` succeeds, the digit loop eats
//!         `"5"`, and then `int("e")` raises
//!         `invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'e'`.
//!     `inf` and `nan` die the same way as the first case. So BR converts no
//!     float at or beyond `1e16`, and none below `1e-4`.
//! 17. **A `Decimal` keeps its trailing zeros, because `str` does.**
//!     `str(Decimal("1.10")) == "1.10"`, so 1.10 is `"unan point unan zero"` —
//!     two fraction words for a value a float would render with one. Likewise
//!     `Decimal("5.00")` is `"pemp point zero zero"` while `Decimal("5")`, whose
//!     `str` has no `"."` at all, takes the *integer* branch and is plain
//!     `"pemp"`. This is why the value cannot be normalised on the way in.
//! 18. **`Decimal`'s exponent threshold is not `float`'s.** `Decimal.__str__`
//!     goes scientific at `_exp > 0` or `adjusted exponent < -6`, and writes the
//!     exponent unpadded with a capital `E`: `str(Decimal("1e-7")) == "1E-7"`
//!     (versus `repr(1e-07) == "1e-07"`), and `str(Decimal("1e-5")) ==
//!     "0.00001"` where the float renders `"1e-05"` and raises. So `Decimal`
//!     spells fractions four orders of magnitude smaller than `float` can.
//! 19. **`98746251323029.99` survives as a `Decimal` and would not as a float**
//!     (issue #603). It renders `"98746251323029 point nav nav"` — the integer
//!     part going through `_int_to_word`'s 10^9 digit fallback (quirk 1).
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python quirks
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. All of the following are odd-looking but are
//! exactly what Python emits, verified against the interpreter:
//!
//! 1. **`_int_to_word` falls back to digits at 10^9.** The if/elif chain stops
//!    at `number < 1000000000` and the final `else` is
//!    `return str(number)  # Fallback for very large numbers`. So
//!    `to_cardinal(10**9)` == `"1000000000"` — bare digits, not words — and
//!    `to_ordinal(10**9)` == `"1000000000-vet"`. The negative sign is stripped
//!    by `to_cardinal` before `_int_to_word` runs, so
//!    `to_cardinal(-10**9)` == `"minus 1000000000"`. This is why the fallback
//!    must use arbitrary-precision `to_string()`: the corpus reaches 10^21,
//!    well past `u64`. Confirmed by corpus rows for 10^9, 10^12, 10^18, 10^21.
//! 2. **Zero is spelled by an accident of falsiness.** `_int_to_word(0)` reads
//!    `return self.ones[0] if self.ones[0] else "zero"`. `ones[0]` is the empty
//!    string, which is falsy in Python, so the ternary *always* takes the else
//!    branch and the first operand is dead. Result: `"zero"`.
//! 3. **No `verify_ordinal` call.** `Num2Word_Base.verify_ordinal` would raise
//!    `TypeError` for negative ordinals, but BR's `to_ordinal` never calls it.
//!    So `to_ordinal(-1)` == `"minus unan-vet"` rather than raising — the
//!    suffix lands on the end of the whole phrase, not on the number word.
//!    Likewise `to_ordinal(-100)` == `"minus unan kant-vet"`.
//! 4. **Hundreds are never bare.** The `number < 1000` branch always emits
//!    `self.ones[hundreds_val] + " " + self.hundred`, so 100 is `"unan kant"`
//!    ("one hundred"), never `"kant"`. Same for `mil` and `milion` via the
//!    recursive calls: 1000 is `"unan mil"`, 10^6 is `"unan milion"`.
//! 5. **Breton's vigesimal tens are stored whole**, spaces and hyphens
//!    included: `tens[7]` is `"dek ha tri-ugent"` (70) and `tens[9]` is
//!    `"dek ha pevar-ugent"` (90). Concatenation is therefore blind to word
//!    count — 99 becomes `"dek ha pevar-ugent nav"`.
//! 6. **`negword` keeps its trailing space.** `setup` sets `"minus "` (unlike
//!    `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal`, which does `self.negword.strip()`). BR's
//!    `to_cardinal` prepends it raw and `.strip()`s the finished string, so the
//!    single space survives between sign and number and nowhere else.
//! 7. **`_int_to_word`'s own negative branch is dead code** on every in-scope
//!    path: `to_cardinal` strips the `"-"` at the string level and feeds
//!    `int(n)` a non-negative value. It is only reachable from `to_currency`
//!    (out of scope). Reproduced anyway in [`int_to_word`] for fidelity.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! For **integer** input: none. BR raises nothing in the four supported modes:
//! no `MAXVAL` means no `OverflowError`, no `verify_ordinal` means no
//! `TypeError`, and every table index is bounded by an arithmetic guard.
//! Accordingly every integer method here returns `Ok`, and the frozen corpus
//! agrees — all 324 in-scope `br` rows carry `"ok": true`.
//!
//! For **float / Decimal** input the only error is `ValueError`, raised by
//! `int()` on a token it cannot parse (quirk 16), and it is always
//! [`N2WError::Value`]. There is still no `OverflowError` — `1e16` fails
//! because `repr` wrote an `e`, not because BR checked a bound.
//!
//! # The currency surface
//!
//! `Num2Word_BR` defines `CURRENCY_FORMS` (EUR and USD only) and overrides
//! `to_currency` outright. It defines **no** `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`, **no**
//! `CURRENCY_PRECISION`, and does not override `pluralize`, `_money_verbose`,
//! `_cents_verbose`, `_cents_terse` or `to_cheque` — all of those stay at
//! `Num2Word_Base`, which is exactly what the trait defaults already model. So
//! only [`Lang::lang_name`], [`Lang::currency_forms`] and [`Lang::to_currency`]
//! are overridden here.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is therefore the inherited `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque`, driving
//! `currency::default_to_cheque`. It looks the code up in `CURRENCY_FORMS`
//! directly and raises `NotImplementedError` on a miss, which is why
//! `cheque:EUR`/`cheque:USD` succeed while `cheque:GBP` and friends raise —
//! matching the corpus exactly. Its `divisor` is
//! `CURRENCY_PRECISION.get(currency, 100)`, and BR's `CURRENCY_PRECISION` is
//! the empty inherited dict, so it is **always** 100: `cheque:KWD` would use
//! `/100`, not `/1000`, if KWD were in the table at all.
//!
//! ## Further Python quirks reproduced (currency)
//!
//! 8. **An unknown currency code silently becomes euros.** `to_currency` reads
//!    `self.CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, list(self.CURRENCY_FORMS.values())[0])`.
//!    The fallback is the *first inserted* entry — EUR — so `currency="GBP"`,
//!    `"JPY"`, `"KWD"` … all render as euros instead of raising. Verified
//!    against the interpreter: `to_currency(12.34, currency="JPY")` ==
//!    `"dek daou euroioù tregont pevar sentimoù"`. This fallback lives *only*
//!    in `to_currency`; [`Lang::currency_forms`] stays a faithful
//!    `CURRENCY_FORMS[code]` (returning `None` on a miss) so the inherited
//!    `to_cheque` still raises for the same codes.
//! 9. **`CURRENCY_PRECISION` is never consulted by `to_currency`.** The cents
//!    field is hard-coded to two digits via `parts[1][:2].ljust(2, "0")`, so
//!    3-decimal currencies get no special handling and the `divisor`
//!    machinery of `base.to_currency` is bypassed entirely. `0.5` is 50
//!    subunits for every code.
//! 10. **The int/float split is invisible here.** `base.to_currency` branches
//!    on `isinstance(val, int)`; BR does not — it branches on whether
//!    `str(val)` contains a `"."`. The two agree anyway, because a whole
//!    float stringifies with a `"0"` fraction: `1.0` → `parts[1] == "0"` →
//!    `int("00")` → `0`, which is falsy, so `if cents and right:` drops the
//!    segment just as the int path would. Both `1` and `1.0` give
//!    `"unan euro"`. The distinction is still honoured in the value passed in.
//! 11. **`cents=False` drops the cents segment rather than going terse.**
//!    `if cents and right:` is the only guard; there is no `_cents_terse`
//!    branch, so `cents=False` loses the subunits entirely.
//! 12. **A float too large to stringify plainly raises `ValueError`.** Python
//!    takes `str(val)`, so `1e16` and above render in scientific notation and
//!    `int("1e+16")` raises. Confirmed against the interpreter:
//!    `to_currency(1e21)` → `ValueError`. `BigDecimal`'s `Display` preserves
//!    the same `1e+21` form, so `BigInt::from_str` fails on exactly the same
//!    inputs and [`N2WError::Value`] reproduces the type natively.
//! 13. **`_int_to_word`'s digit fallback is reachable from currency.** Unlike
//!    the four integer modes, `to_currency(1234567890.0)` yields
//!    `"1234567890 euroioù"` — bare digits, per quirk 1.
