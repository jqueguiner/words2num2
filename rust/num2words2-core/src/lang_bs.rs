//! Port of `lang_BS.py` (Bosnian, Latin script).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_BS` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but its
//! `setup()` defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so the
//! `hasattr` probe in `Num2Word_Base.__init__` fails and Python never builds
//! `self.cards` nor sets `self.MAXVAL`. `to_cardinal` is overridden outright
//! and drives a hand-rolled `_int_to_word` recursion. Consequently
//! `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and there is
//! **no overflow check** — see bug 2 below for what happens instead.
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` (unchanged by BS):
//!   * `setup()` sets `negword = "minus "` (note the **trailing space**) and
//!     `pointword = "zarez"`.
//!
//! Overridden by BS, all four in scope:
//!   * `to_cardinal` / `to_ordinal` / `to_ordinal_num` / `to_year`.
//!
//! # The float / Decimal path (phase 3)
//!
//! BS does **not** override `to_cardinal_float` — it never reaches it at all.
//! `num2words()` dispatches `to="cardinal"` straight to `Num2Word_BS
//! .to_cardinal(number)` with the raw `float`/`Decimal`, and that override's
//! very first statement is `n = str(number).strip()`. So `Num2Word_Base
//! .to_cardinal`'s `assert int(value) == value` guard — the thing that
//! delegates to `to_cardinal_float` for the other 26 languages — is dead code
//! for BS. See [`LangBs::to_cardinal_float`].
//!
//! The consequence is that **none of `float2tuple`'s binary arithmetic runs**.
//! BS never computes `abs(value - pre) * 10**precision`, so the f64 artefacts
//! `floatpath.rs` is built to preserve, and the `< 0.01` heuristic that
//! rescues them, simply do not arise. `2.675` is the string `"2.675"` and its
//! fractional digits are read off as characters. The two routes agree on
//! `2.675`/`1.005` precisely *because* that heuristic exists to recover the
//! `repr` digits that the string route gets for free.
//!
//! What BS needs instead is `str(number)` itself, byte for byte — see
//! [`py_repr_float`] and [`py_str_decimal`]. Both are reproduced here rather
//! than approximated, because BS's parse is exact-match brittle: a `repr` that
//! tips into exponent notation feeds `"e"` to `int()` and raises ValueError
//! (bug 9), and a `repr` that loses its `".0"` silently skips the whole
//! `zarez` segment.
//!
//! `self.precision` is never read on this path, so the `precision=` kwarg is a
//! **no-op** for BS — confirmed live: `precision=0/1/3/5` all return
//! `num2words(1.005, lang="bs")`'s plain `"jedan zarez nula nula pet"`.
//! `precision_override` is therefore accepted and ignored.
//!
//! `to_year(val, longval=True)` ignores `longval` entirely and just returns
//! `self.to_cardinal(val)`, which is exactly what `Num2Word_Base.to_year`
//! already does — so the trait default is left in place here (it dispatches
//! through `&self` and picks up the `to_cardinal` override below).
//!
//! No cross-call mutable state: every method is a pure function of its
//! argument. Nothing to teach the dispatcher to skip.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. All of the following are wrong Bosnian but
//! are exactly what Python emits, and each is confirmed against the frozen
//! corpus:
//!
//! 1. **The teens are malformed.** `_int_to_word` builds 11..=19 as
//!    `ones[n - 10] + "aest"`, but real Bosnian teens are built on a `-naest`
//!    suffix with stem changes. So Python emits "dvaaest" (12), "triaest"
//!    (13), "petaest" (15), "šestaest" (16), "sedamaest" (17), "devetaest"
//!    (19) — correct forms would be dvanaest / trinaest / petnaest / šesnaest
//!    / sedamnaest / devetnaest. Only 11 ("jedanaest") and 14 ("četiriaest"
//!    vs. correct "četrnaest")… note 11 lands right purely by accident. All
//!    preserved verbatim; see [`LangBs::int_to_word_small`].
//! 2. **Everything >= 10^9 falls back to digits.** The final `else` of
//!    `_int_to_word` is `return str(number)`, so `to_cardinal(10**9)` is the
//!    *string* `"1000000000"`, not words — and `to_ordinal(10**9)` is
//!    `"1000000000."`. This is BS's de facto ceiling: it never raises
//!    `OverflowError`, it silently degrades. The `milijarda` (10^9) and
//!    `bilion` (10^12) entries of `self.scale` are therefore **unreachable
//!    dead data** — nothing in the module ever reads `self.scale` at all.
//! 3. **`hiljada` never agrees for 1 or for compound thousands.** Exactly
//!    1000 renders as bare "hiljada" with no leading "jedan" (real Bosnian:
//!    "hiljadu"), and the 2/3/4 -> "hiljade" rule keys off the *whole*
//!    thousands count rather than its last digit, so 21000 becomes
//!    "dvadeset jedan hiljada" (correct: "dvadeset jedna hiljada"). Likewise
//!    10^6 is bare "milion" with no "jedan".
//! 4. **A redundant branch.** The `hundreds_val == 3 or hundreds_val == 4`
//!    arm and the `else` arm compute the identical expression
//!    (`self.ones[hundreds_val] + "sto"`). Collapsed below — the two arms are
//!    textually the same expression, so this cannot change output — but noted
//!    here so a reader diffing against Python does not think a case was lost.
//! 5. **`to_ordinal` is barely an ordinal.** Only 1/2/3 get real ordinal words
//!    ("prvi"/"drugi"/"treći"); every other value is just the cardinal with a
//!    "." glued on, including 0 ("nula.") and negatives ("minus jedan.").
//! 6. **`to_currency` silently accepts any currency code; `to_cheque` does
//!    not.** `to_currency` does `CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency,
//!    CURRENCY_FORMS["BAM"])`, so an unknown code is *not* an error — it is
//!    quietly billed in convertible marks. `num2words(2, lang="bs",
//!    to="currency", currency="JPY")` is "dva marke". The corpus pins this for
//!    GBP/JPY/KWD/BHD/INR/CNY/CHF, all of which come back as marks/feninga
//!    while `to_cheque` on the same codes raises `NotImplementedError`.
//! 7. **The unit form never agrees for 1.** `left == 1` takes `cr1[0]`, which
//!    is the bare nominative, so BAM gives "jedan marka" (correct Bosnian:
//!    "jedna marka" — *marka* is feminine). EUR/USD are masculine and land
//!    right by luck ("jedan euro", "jedan dolar").
//! 8. **Cents are truncated to two digits, not rounded, and `cents=False`
//!    drops them.** `int(parts[1][:2].ljust(2, "0"))` slices the *string*, so
//!    1.999 is "jedan euro devedeset devet centi" (99c, not a rounded 100).
//!    And `if cents and right` means `cents=False` omits the subunit segment
//!    entirely rather than rendering it tersely as `Num2Word_Base` would.
//! 9. **Any value whose `str()` uses exponent notation raises ValueError.**
//!    `to_cardinal` feeds the pieces of `str(number)` to `int()` with no
//!    guard, so as soon as `repr` switches to scientific form the parse blows
//!    up on the letter. Confirmed live, and note the *two distinct* messages
//!    depending on whether a "." survives to split on:
//!      * `1e16`, `1e-05`, `1e+100`, `1e-300`, `Decimal("1E+2")`,
//!        `Decimal("1E-7")` — no ".", so `int(n)` sees the whole literal:
//!        `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1e+16'`.
//!      * `1.5e-05`, `1.5e+16`, `Decimal("1.5E+3")` — the "." splits, `int(left)`
//!        succeeds, then the `for digit in right` loop hits the exponent
//!        letter: `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'e'`.
//!    `float("nan")`/`float("inf")`/`float("-inf")` land in the first shape
//!    ('nan' / 'inf' / 'inf' — the sign is stripped before `int()` sees it),
//!    as do `Decimal("NaN")`/`Decimal("Infinity")`. This is BS's *lower* and
//!    *upper* de facto ceiling on the float path, the mirror of bug 2's silent
//!    digit fallback on the integer path — and unlike bug 2 it is loud.
//!    Reproduced in [`py_int`]; there is no OverflowError anywhere near it.
//!
//! # Currency (phase 2)
//!
//! `Num2Word_BS` overrides `to_currency` **wholesale** and shares almost
//! nothing with `Num2Word_Base`'s currency machinery:
//!
//!   * It never calls `pluralize`, `_money_verbose`, `_cents_verbose` or
//!     `_cents_terse` — the Slavic 1 / 2-4 / else form choice is open-coded
//!     twice, inline, once for the unit and once for the subunit.
//!   * It never reads `CURRENCY_PRECISION` (which is `{}` anyway, so every
//!     code is precision 100) nor `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` (also `{}`), so the
//!     `adjective=` argument is **silently ignored** and 3-decimal (KWD/BHD)
//!     and 0-decimal (JPY) currencies get the plain 2-decimal treatment.
//!   * It does not go anywhere near `parse_currency_parts`: it re-stringifies
//!     the value with `str(val)` and slices the decimal point out by hand.
//!
//! `CURRENCY_FORMS` is BS's own class dict — three codes, each with a full
//! three-form tuple. It is *not* the dict `Num2Word_EN.__init__` mutates (see
//! `PORTING_CURRENCY.md`); the live interpreter confirms BS sees exactly
//! `{BAM, EUR, USD}` and empty `CURRENCY_PRECISION`/`CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is **not** overridden, so it comes from `Num2Word_Base` via the
//! trait default: it indexes `CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` directly and raises
//! `NotImplementedError` on a miss. That is why the two lookups differ and
//! must stay separate — see `LangBs::currency_forms` and bug 6.
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! The four integer modes are total over the integers: there is no overflow
//! check (bug 2), no table lookup that can miss, and no `int()` of a parsed
//! token. `to_currency` is likewise total — its `.get(..., BAM)` fallback
//! cannot miss. The only error on this surface is the `NotImplementedError`
//! that `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque` raises for a code outside `CURRENCY_FORMS`,
//! and that is produced by `currency::default_to_cheque` from the `None` that
//! `LangBs::currency_forms` returns.
