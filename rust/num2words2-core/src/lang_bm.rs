//! Port of `lang_BM.py` (Bambara).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_BM` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so the base
//! `__init__` never builds `self.cards` and never sets `MAXVAL`. `to_cardinal`
//! is overridden outright and drives a private `_int_to_word` recursion.
//! Consequently `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here,
//! and there is **no overflow check** — see the ceiling note below, which is a
//! silent fallback rather than an `OverflowError`.
//!
//! `setup()` only assigns constants; there is no cross-call mutable state and
//! no `str_to_number` handshake (BM inherits `Num2Word_Base.str_to_number`,
//! which is a plain `Decimal(value)`), so the stateless Rust path is safe to
//! dispatch to for all four in-scope modes — and for the float/Decimal path
//! below, which is the same overridden `to_cardinal`.
//!
//! Bambara builds numbers with the **multiplier after the base word**:
//! 900 is `kɛmɛ kɔnɔntɔn` ("hundred nine"), 9_000_000 is `miliyɔn kɔnɔntɔn`.
//! Reading that as reversed is a misreading of the language, not a bug — it is
//! exactly what Python emits.
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` and left alone by BM:
//!   * `is_title` is `False` (set by `__init__`, never flipped by `setup`).
//!     Irrelevant regardless: BM overrides `to_cardinal` and so never routes
//!     through `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal`, the only caller of `self.title()`.
//!     `exclude_title = ["ni", "dɔgɔ"]` is therefore dead on *every* BM path,
//!     the float one included: BM interpolates `self.pointword` raw and never
//!     calls `self.title()`. `pointword = "ni"` is live — see the float path.
//!   * `self.precision` (2, from `__init__`) is **never read** by BM. Nothing
//!     in BM's `to_cardinal` consults it, so the `precision=` kwarg that
//!     `__init__.py` threads in by assigning `converter.precision` has no
//!     effect at all: `num2words(2.675, lang="bm", precision=1)` is still
//!     `"fila ni wɔɔrɔ wolonfila duuru"`. Hence `precision_override` is
//!     accepted and ignored in [`LangBm::to_cardinal_float`]. Verified against
//!     the live interpreter.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python quirks
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. Both of these look wrong and are kept:
//!
//! 1. **The ceiling is a silent fallback to digits.** `_int_to_word` handles
//!    values below 10^9 and then simply `return str(number)`. So
//!    `to_cardinal(10**9)` == `"1000000000"` — bare digits, no words, no
//!    exception. Bambara has no word above `miliyɔn` in this table, and the
//!    module degrades rather than raising `OverflowError`. Corpus rows confirm
//!    this all the way up to 10^21, which is why [`int_to_word`] keeps
//!    everything in `BigInt` and never casts the input to a fixed-width int.
//! 2. **`to_ordinal` inherits that fallback**, so at or above 10^9 it collapses
//!    onto `to_ordinal_num`: both `to_ordinal(10**9)` and
//!    `to_ordinal_num(10**9)` return `"1000000000nan"`. Below 10^9 they differ
//!    ("miliyɔnnan" vs "1000000nan").
//! 3. **The two paths spell the sign differently**, which the collapse in (2)
//!    makes visible: `to_cardinal`/`to_ordinal` render the sign as the *word*
//!    `dɔgɔ` (they strip "-" and prepend `negword`), while `to_ordinal_num`
//!    stringifies the input untouched and keeps the ASCII "-". So at 10^9 the
//!    two do **not** converge for negatives:
//!    `to_ordinal(-10**9)` == `"dɔgɔ 1000000000nan"` but
//!    `to_ordinal_num(-10**9)` == `"-1000000000nan"`. No corpus row covers
//!    this combination; both were verified against the live interpreter.
//!
//! Two further behaviours are unremarkable but worth stating, since they are
//! where sibling languages tend to crash:
//!
//!   * `negword` is `"dɔgɔ "` *with a trailing space*, and `to_cardinal`
//!     `.strip()`s the concatenation. The trailing space is always absorbed by
//!     the following word, so the strip is a no-op in practice — but it is
//!     reproduced via `trim()` rather than assumed away.
//!   * Unlike `lang_PL`, BM's `to_ordinal` does **not** crash on 0 or on
//!     negatives: `to_ordinal(0)` == `"funan"`, `to_ordinal(-1)` ==
//!     `"dɔgɔ kelennan"`. No input in scope raises, so this port returns no
//!     `N2WError` variant on any path.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `Num2Word_BM` overrides `to_currency` **outright** — none of
//! `Num2Word_Base.to_currency`'s machinery runs. Consequences, all
//! corpus-pinned:
//!
//! * **An unknown currency code does not raise.** Python falls back to
//!   `list(self.CURRENCY_FORMS.values())[0]`, which dict insertion order makes
//!   XOF. So `to_currency(1, "JPY")` is `"kelen seefa"`, not a
//!   `NotImplementedError`. See [`FALLBACK_CODE`].
//! * **`CURRENCY_PRECISION` is never consulted.** BM's `to_currency` truncates
//!   the fraction to two digits by *string slicing*, so KWD/BHD (3-decimal)
//!   and JPY (0-decimal) get plain 1/100 subunits like everything else.
//! * **`pluralize` is never called** by BM's own `to_currency`; it indexes
//!   `cr1[1]`/`cr1[0]` directly. Every BM form is a 2-tuple of *identical*
//!   strings (`("seefa", "seefa")`), so the singular/plural choice is
//!   observationally a no-op — but it is reproduced rather than dropped.
//! * **`adjective` is accepted and ignored**; `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` is empty.
//!
//! # The float/Decimal path
//!
//! BM does **not** override `to_cardinal_float`, and `Num2Word_Base`'s never
//! runs either: BM overrides `to_cardinal` and handles non-integers inline,
//! before the base class gets a look in. So none of `floatpath.rs` applies
//! here — **no `float2tuple`, no `10**precision` scaling, no banker's
//! rounding, and none of the f64 artefacts that path exists to preserve**.
//! BM's whole float path is one line:
//!
//! ```python
//! n = str(number).strip()
//! ```
//!
//! and then pure string surgery on the result: split at the ".", `int()` the
//! left, and map each *character* of the right through `self.ones`. The
//! consequences run opposite to every language that inherits base's path:
//!
//! * **The artefact cases are trivially right.** `str(2.675)` is `"2.675"`
//!   (`repr` is shortest-round-trip), so the digits are `6 7 5` by
//!   construction. Base's path is the one that has to compute
//!   `674.9999999999998` and rescue it with `abs(round(post) - post) < 0.01`;
//!   BM never scales, so there is nothing to rescue. Same for `1.005`.
//! * **`str()` is the whole spec**, so this port lives or dies on reproducing
//!   `repr(float)` and `str(Decimal)` byte for byte — see
//!   [`python_float_repr`] and [`python_decimal_str`].
//! * **Trailing zeros are significant**, because they are characters rather
//!   than a computed remainder: `Decimal("1.10")` is `"kelen ni kelen fu"`,
//!   and `Decimal("5.00")` is `"duuru ni fu fu"`.
//! * **Exponent notation raises `ValueError`**, since `int()` chokes on the
//!   literal — the same hole `split_currency` documents, reached the same way.
//!   `1e16` → `"1e+16"` → no `"."` → `int("1e+16")` raises quoting the whole
//!   literal; `1.5e16` → `"1.5e+16"` → the `"."` branch → `int("e")` raises
//!   quoting just the offending *character*. Both messages are reproduced.
//! * **`float("nan")`/`float("inf")` raise `ValueError` too**, not TypeError:
//!   `str()` gives `"nan"`/`"inf"`, and `int()` rejects them like any other
//!   non-numeric literal.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is **not** overridden, so `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque` runs — and
//! *that* one indexes `self.CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` and raises
//! `NotImplementedError` on a miss. Hence the asymmetry the corpus records:
//! `to_currency(1234.56, "GBP")` == `"ba ni … seefa …"` while
//! `to_cheque(1234.56, "GBP")` raises. Only [`LangBm::lang_name`] and
//! [`LangBm::currency_forms`] are needed to serve it; `currency_precision`
//! (100), `money_verbose` (→ `to_cardinal`) and the rest stay at their trait
//! defaults, which already mirror `Num2Word_Base`.
