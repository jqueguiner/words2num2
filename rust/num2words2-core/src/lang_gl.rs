//! Port of `lang_GL.py` (Galician).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_GL` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so the
//! `hasattr` probe in `Num2Word_Base.__init__` never fires: Python builds
//! **no `self.cards`** and **never sets `self.MAXVAL`**. `to_cardinal` is
//! overridden outright and drives `_int_to_word`, a plain recursive
//! divide-by-scale routine. Consequently `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at
//! their trait defaults here, and there is **no overflow check at all** —
//! `MAXVAL` does not exist on the instance, and touching it would be an
//! `AttributeError`. Nothing in the four in-scope modes touches it.
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` and left alone by GL — but GL happens to
//! re-declare two of them identically, so the observable behaviour is the
//! same either way:
//!   * `to_ordinal_num(value) -> str(value) + "."`  (GL overrides; the base
//!     default would have returned the value untouched, so this one *is* a
//!     real override.)
//!   * `to_year(val, longval=True) -> self.to_cardinal(val)` (GL overrides
//!     with a body identical to the base default; either way it delegates
//!     through `&self` and picks up the `to_cardinal` override below.)
//!
//! No cross-call mutable state: GL defines no `str_to_number` and stashes no
//! pending flags, so the stateless Rust path is a faithful stand-in for the
//! Python dispatcher's fast path.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `Num2Word_GL` declares its own `CURRENCY_FORMS` **dict literal** — it does
//! not subclass `Num2Word_EUR`, so it never sees the dict that
//! `Num2Word_EN.__init__` mutates in place, and none of EN's ~24 extra codes
//! (JPY/KWD/CHF/INR/...) leak in. Verified against the live interpreter: the
//! table is exactly `{"EUR", "USD"}` and `id(Num2Word_GL.CURRENCY_FORMS) !=
//! id(Num2Word_Base.CURRENCY_FORMS)`.
//!
//! `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` and `CURRENCY_PRECISION` are both inherited from
//! `Num2Word_Base` and both are `{}`, so `currency_adjective` and
//! `currency_precision` stay at their trait defaults (`None` / `100`).
//!
//! GL **overrides `to_currency` outright** — `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` is
//! never reached, so `pluralize`, `_cents_verbose`, `_cents_terse`,
//! `parse_currency_parts` and the whole `CURRENCY_PRECISION` machinery are
//! dead code for this language. `pluralize` therefore stays at the trait
//! default that raises, exactly mirroring `Num2Word_Base.pluralize` — which
//! also raises `NotImplementedError` and is likewise never called.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is **not** overridden, so the base implementation runs: it
//! reaches `_money_verbose` (-> `to_cardinal`) and indexes
//! `self.CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` *directly*, which is why cheques raise
//! where `to_currency` silently falls back. See bugs 12 and 13 below.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs / oddities — currency
//!
//! 10. **An unknown currency code never raises.** `to_currency` looks the code
//!     up as `self.CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, list(self.CURRENCY_FORMS
//!     .values())[0])`, so `GBP`, `JPY`, `KWD`, `BHD`, `INR`, `CNY`, `CHF` —
//!     everything outside `{EUR, USD}` — silently render as **euros**, with
//!     `céntimo(s)` subunits. Corpus-confirmed: `currency:JPY` of `1` is
//!     `"un euro"`, not a `NotImplementedError`. See [`CURRENCY_FALLBACK_KEY`].
//! 11. **`CURRENCY_PRECISION` is ignored by `to_currency`.** The subunit
//!     divisor is hard-wired to 100 by the `[:2].ljust(2, "0")` string slice,
//!     so the 3-decimal currencies get cents rather than mils and the
//!     0-decimal ones are not rounded to whole units: `currency:KWD` of
//!     `1234.56` is `"... cincuenta seis céntimos"` (56/100), and
//!     `currency:JPY` of `12.34` still prints a cents segment. Moot in
//!     practice — bug 10 means neither code reaches its own forms anyway.
//! 12. **`to_cheque` and `to_currency` disagree about unknown codes.** GL
//!     inherits `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque`, whose `self.CURRENCY_FORMS[
//!     currency]` is a bare subscript, so it raises `NotImplementedError` for
//!     the very codes `to_currency` happily aliases to euros. Corpus-confirmed:
//!     `cheque:GBP` -> `NotImplementedError`, `currency:GBP` -> `"un euro"`.
//! 13. **Cents are truncated, never rounded.** `int(parts[1][:2].ljust(2,
//!     "0"))` slices the *decimal string*: `12.345` -> 34 céntimos (not 35),
//!     and `0.001` -> `"00"` -> 0 -> the cents segment vanishes entirely.
//! 14. **`cents=False` drops the cents segment instead of digitising it.**
//!     `Num2Word_Base` routes `cents=False` to `_cents_terse` ("56"); GL's
//!     guard is `if cents and right:`, so `cents=False` emits no cents at all.
//! 15. **`adjective=` is accepted and silently ignored.** GL takes the kwarg
//!     to keep the base signature but never reads it, and its inherited
//!     `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` is empty regardless.
//! 16. **Zero cents suppress the segment even for floats.** `1.0` -> parts[1]
//!     is `"0"` -> `right == 0` -> falsy -> `"un euro"`. GL reaches the same
//!     place as the base's `isinstance(val, int)` shortcut, but by a different
//!     road: it never inspects the type, it just tests whether `right` is
//!     truthy. So for GL — uniquely — `1` and `1.0` genuinely agree, and the
//!     `Int`/`Decimal` split of [`CurrencyValue`] is behaviourally inert here.
//!     It is still honoured on both arms rather than collapsed.
//! 17. **Scientific notation is a `ValueError`, not a number.** `to_currency`
//!     parses `str(val)`, so `1e16` -> `parts[0] == "1e+16"` ->
//!     `int("1e+16")` -> `ValueError`. See [`LangGl::split_currency`].
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs / oddities
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. Every one of these looks wrong and is
//! exactly what Python emits — all confirmed against the frozen corpus:
//!
//! 1. **No teens, no compound tens.** `_int_to_word` has no 11..19 table and
//!    joins tens to ones with a bare space, so 11 == "dez un" (literally
//!    "ten one", not "once") and 21 == "vinte un" (not "vinte e un").
//!    Galician normally uses "e" between tens and units; GL never emits it.
//! 2. **"un cento", not "cen"/"cento".** The hundreds branch is
//!    unconditionally `ones[h] + " cento"`, so 100 == "un cento" (real
//!    Galician is "cen") and 200 == "dous cento" (real: "douscentos").
//! 3. **"un mil", not "mil".** The thousands branch always recurses on the
//!    multiplier, so 1000 == "un mil" (real Galician: "mil").
//! 4. **`millón` is never pluralised** and the scale word is never joined
//!    with "de": 10^7 == "dez millón" (real: "dez millóns").
//! 5. **Hard ceiling at 10^9 that returns digits instead of words.** The
//!    final `else` of `_int_to_word` is `return str(number)` — a "fallback
//!    for very large numbers" that silently emits the numeral. So
//!    `to_cardinal(10**9)` == "1000000000" (a *string of digits*, not
//!    words), `to_ordinal(10**9)` == "1000000000-o", and this holds for
//!    every value >= 10^9 no matter how large. It does **not** raise
//!    `OverflowError`. Verified against corpus rows up to 10^21.
//!    Negatives inherit it too: `to_cardinal(-10**9)` == "minus 1000000000".
//! 6. **`to_ordinal` is just the cardinal plus a literal `"-o"` suffix**,
//!    hyphen included: 0 == "zero-o", 100 == "un cento-o". Not a real
//!    Galician ordinal ("primeiro", "centésimo").
//! 7. **`to_ordinal` accepts negatives** — it never calls
//!    `verify_ordinal()`, so `to_ordinal(-1)` == "minus un-o" rather than
//!    raising `TypeError` the way most modules would.
//! 8. **`negword` is `"minus "`** — the English word, with a trailing space,
//!    in a Galician module (real: "menos"). GL's `to_cardinal` interpolates
//!    it *raw* rather than via the base's `"%s " % self.negword.strip()`
//!    idiom; the trailing space makes the two coincide, and the final
//!    `.strip()` cleans up the rest. See [`NEGWORD`].
//! 9. **`ones[0]` is `""`**, so `_int_to_word(0)` takes the
//!    `self.ones[0] if self.ones[0] else "zero"` branch and yields the
//!    English-ish "zero" (which is, coincidentally, also correct Galician).
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! None of the four in-scope modes can raise for integer input: every list
//! index is derived from a `% 10` or `/ 100` of a bounded positive value, so
//! `ones`/`tens` are never indexed out of range, and the 10^9 fallback
//! swallows what would otherwise overflow. `Result` is returned only to
//! satisfy the trait.
