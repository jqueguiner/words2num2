//! Port of `lang_CEB.py` (Cebuano).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_CEB` subclasses `Num2Word_Base`, but
//! its `setup()` defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`.
//! The `any(hasattr(self, field) for field in [...])` guard in
//! `Num2Word_Base.__init__` is therefore False, so Python never builds
//! `self.cards` and never sets `self.MAXVAL`. `to_cardinal` is overridden
//! outright and drives `_int_to_word` recursively. Consequently
//! `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and there is
//! **no overflow check at all** — see bug 1 below for what happens instead.
//!
//! Inheritance chain: `Num2Word_CEB` -> `Num2Word_Base` -> `object`. Every
//! in-scope method (`to_cardinal`, `to_ordinal`, `to_ordinal_num`, `to_year`)
//! is overridden by CEB itself, so nothing is inherited from `base.py` for the
//! four supported modes. `title()` is inherited but inert: `is_title` stays
//! False (set by `Num2Word_Base.__init__`, never flipped by CEB), so the
//! `exclude_title` list CEB populates is dead weight. It is mirrored here for
//! fidelity but can never affect output.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. The following look wrong but are exactly
//! what Python emits, each confirmed against the frozen corpus:
//!
//! 1. **`_int_to_word` gives up at 10^9 and returns the bare digits.** The
//!    final `return str(number)` has no word forms above `milyon`, so
//!    `to_cardinal(10**9)` == "1000000000" and `to_cardinal(1234567890)` ==
//!    "1234567890" — digits, not words. This is *not* an OverflowError; the
//!    call succeeds and returns a numeric string. It cascades: `to_ordinal`
//!    prefixes it blindly, so `to_ordinal(10**9)` == "ika-1000000000". This
//!    is why the port must keep `BigInt` all the way down rather than
//!    bounding the input — arbitrarily large values are *valid* input that
//!    simply round-trip to their decimal representation.
//! 2. **`to_ordinal` accepts negatives and emits nonsense.** CEB overrides
//!    `to_ordinal` without the `errmsg_negord` guard that `Num2Word_Base`
//!    applies, so `to_ordinal(-1)` == "ika-minus usa" (an "ordinal" built on
//!    a minus sign) rather than raising. Likewise `to_ordinal_num(-1)` ==
//!    "ika--1", with the doubled hyphen.
//! 3. **`to_ordinal` computes the cardinal it may discard.** `cardinal =
//!    self.to_cardinal(number)` runs *before* the `if number == 1` check that
//!    returns "una" and ignores it. Harmless (no side effects), but the
//!    evaluation order is preserved below so the two stay lockstep if either
//!    ever grows one.
//! 4. **No teens.** 11 is "napulo ug usa" ("ten and one"), not a dedicated
//!    form. Correct Cebuano is arguably "napulog usa"; the corpus freezes the
//!    spaced form, so that is what ships.
//! 5. **`gatos`/`libo`/`milyon` join with a bare space, but `ug` ("and") only
//!    appears below 1000.** So 1001 is "usa libo usa" (no "ug"), while 101 is
//!    "gatos ug usa". Asymmetric, and preserved verbatim.
//! 6. **A float whose repr goes exponential is a `ValueError`, not a number.**
//!    `to_cardinal` feeds the halves of `str(number)` straight to `int()`, and
//!    CPython's float repr switches to exponent form at `decpt > 16` or
//!    `decpt <= -4`. So `1e15` is fine ("1000000000000000 puntos siro", digits
//!    by bug 1) but one step up:
//!
//!    | input | `str()` | result |
//!    |---|---|---|
//!    | `1e16` | `'1e+16'` | `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1e+16'` |
//!    | `1e-05` | `'1e-05'` | `ValueError: ... : '1e-05'` |
//!    | `1.5e20` | `'1.5e+20'` | `ValueError: ... : 'e'` |
//!    | `Decimal("1E+2")` | `'1E+2'` | `ValueError: ... : '1E+2'` |
//!
//!    The `1.5e+20` row is the interesting one: the string *does* contain a
//!    ".", so it takes the fraction branch, `int("1")` succeeds, the digit
//!    loop emits "lima" for the '5' — and only then does `int('e')` blow up.
//!    Hence the message quotes `'e'`, the single offending character, not the
//!    whole token. All four are corpus-absent but live-interpreter confirmed.
//!    Contrast `Num2Word_Base`, which would cheerfully render `1e16` via
//!    `float2tuple`; CEB cannot reach that code.
//!
//! # Notes on unreachable Python paths
//!
//! * `_int_to_word` is never called with a negative: `to_cardinal` strips the
//!   sign from the *string* before recursing, and every internal recursion
//!   passes a `divmod` remainder. Were a negative to reach it, Python's
//!   `number < 10` would be True and `self.ones[number]` would silently
//!   negative-index the list (`ones[-1]` == "siyam"). Unreachable in scope, so
//!   not modelled; [`int_to_word`] below takes non-negative values only.
//!
//! # The float/Decimal path does not use `float2tuple`
//!
//! `Num2Word_CEB` overrides `to_cardinal` outright, so `Num2Word_Base`'s
//! `to_cardinal_float`/`float2tuple` never run for CEB — not the
//! `abs(value - pre) * 10**precision` binary arithmetic, not the `< 0.01`
//! rescue heuristic, and not `self.precision`. CEB's very first statement is
//!
//! ```python
//! n = str(number).strip()
//! ```
//!
//! and everything after it is string surgery on that repr: split on the first
//! ".", `int()` the left half, and map the right half **character by
//! character** through `self.ones`. So the port's entire job on this path is to
//! reproduce CPython's `str(float)` and `str(Decimal)` exactly — see
//! [`py_str_f64`] and [`py_str_decimal`]. Three consequences:
//!
//! 1. **The `precision=` kwarg is inert.** The dispatcher does set
//!    `converter.precision` (base's `__init__` gives CEB the attribute, so
//!    `hasattr` passes), but CEB never reads it. Confirmed live:
//!    `num2words(2.675, lang="ceb", precision=1)` and `precision=5` both give
//!    "duha puntos unom pito lima". [`LangCeb::to_cardinal_float`] therefore
//!    ignores `precision_override`, and ignores `FloatValue::precision` too.
//! 2. **The fraction is never rounded or padded** — it is the repr's digits
//!    verbatim. `1.005` -> "usa puntos siro siro lima" and `2.675` -> "duha
//!    puntos unom pito lima" come straight from `str()`, not from the f64
//!    artefact + heuristic dance. (Base happens to agree on both; it does not
//!    agree once the repr goes exponential — see bug 6.)
//! 3. **Trailing zeros survive.** `str(1.0)` is "1.0", so `to_cardinal(1.0)` is
//!    "usa puntos siro", and `str(Decimal("1.10"))` keeps its scale, giving
//!    "usa puntos usa siro".
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! None, for the four integer modes. For integer input there is no card table
//! to overflow, no dict lookup to miss, and no list index that a non-negative
//! value can push out of range.
//!
//! The float/Decimal path adds `Value` (Python `ValueError`) — see bug 6.
//!
//! The currency surface adds exactly two:
//!
//! * `to_cheque` raises `NotImplemented` for an unknown code. CEB inherits it
//!   unchanged from `Num2Word_Base`, which looks the code up with `[]` rather
//!   than `.get` — so it raises exactly where [`LangCeb::to_currency`] silently
//!   falls back to PISO. That asymmetry is real and the corpus pins it:
//!   `currency:GBP` yields "piso", `cheque:GBP` raises.
//! * `to_currency` raises `Value` (Python `ValueError`) when `str(abs(val))`
//!   comes out in exponent notation, because CEB feeds that string straight to
//!   `int()`. `num2words(1e16, lang="ceb", to="currency")` is
//!   `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1e+16'`, not a
//!   number. See [`LangCeb::to_currency`] for which side of that Rust can and
//!   cannot reproduce.
//!
//! Note that an unknown *currency code* never raises from `to_currency` — the
//! `CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, <first entry>)` fallback swallows it.
//!
//! # Currency: what CEB overrides and what it inherits
//!
//! `Num2Word_CEB` defines its own `to_currency` and `pluralize` and its own
//! three-entry `CURRENCY_FORMS`. It defines **no** `CURRENCY_PRECISION` and no
//! `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`, and it does not touch `Num2Word_EUR`'s shared table,
//! so the `lang_EUR`/`Num2Word_EN` mutation trap described in
//! PORTING_CURRENCY.md does not reach CEB. Verified against the live
//! interpreter: `CONVERTER_CLASSES["ceb"].CURRENCY_FORMS` is exactly the three
//! codes below, and both `CURRENCY_PRECISION` and `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` are
//! empty dicts.
//!
//! Because CEB's `to_currency` overrides `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` outright,
//! **none** of base's currency machinery runs: no `CURRENCY_PRECISION` lookup,
//! no zero-decimal (JPY) rounding preamble, no `parse_currency_parts`, no
//! `pluralize` call, no `adjective` handling. CEB reimplements the lot with
//! naive string slicing. That is why `currency_precision` is deliberately left
//! at its default here — overriding it would be dead code that misleads the
//! next reader into thinking JPY behaves differently. It does not.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is *not* overridden, so it comes from `Num2Word_Base` and does
//! consult `CURRENCY_PRECISION` (finding nothing, hence divisor 100 for every
//! code, including KWD/BHD) and `_money_verbose` (base's, hence CEB's
//! `to_cardinal`). The trait defaults reproduce it exactly, so it is not
//! overridden here either.

    ///
    /// 1. **Cents truncate, they do not round.** `parts[1][:2]` discards the
    ///    third decimal onward, where base quantizes ROUND_HALF_UP. So 2.675
    ///    is "kan-uman ug pito sentimo" (67, not 68) and 1.005 is bare "usa
    ///    piso" — the half-cent vanishes rather than rounding up to 01.
    /// 2. **An unknown code cannot raise.** `.get(currency, <first value>)`
    ///    falls back to the *insertion-order first* entry, PHP. Hence
    ///    `currency:JPY` -> "piso", not `NotImplementedError` and not yen.
    ///    The `FALLBACK_CURRENCY` constant resolves that ordering, which a
    ///    `HashMap` cannot express.
    /// 3. **`cents=False` drops the segment entirely** rather than falling back
    ///    to the terse "56" form base would emit.
    /// 4. **`adjective` is accepted and ignored.** CEB has no
    ///    `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`, and unlike base it never consults them.
    ///
    /// `has_decimal` is genuinely irrelevant here, so it is not consulted: CEB
    /// gates the cents segment on `right` being truthy, and `str(Decimal("5"))`
    /// and `str(Decimal("5.00"))` both yield `right == 0`. The int/Decimal
    /// split still matters for *stringification*, not for the guard.
    ///
    /// # The exponent-notation hazard
    ///
    /// `int(parts[0])` is fed raw string output, so any `str(abs(val))` in
    /// exponent form is a `ValueError`, not a number. Python raises on `1e16`,
    /// `1e21`, `1e-05` and `Decimal("1E+2")` alike.
    ///
    /// This side sees only the parsed `BigDecimal`, never Python's original
    /// `str(val)`, so the reproduction is exact in the large-magnitude regime
    /// and lossy in the small one:
    ///
    /// * **Exact for floats >= 1e16.** `BigDecimal`'s `Display` switches to
    ///   `1e+NN` at scale <= -16, and CPython's float repr switches at exactly
    ///   1e16 — the thresholds coincide, so `1e16`/`1e21` raise here with
    ///   byte-identical messages. Below 1e16 both render plain and agree: `1e15`
    ///   is `str()`-ed to "1000000000000000.0", so `left` is 10^15 and bug 1
    ///   hands back the bare digits — "1000000000000000 piso", not words.
    /// * **Diverges for floats < 1e-4 and for `Decimal("1E+n")`.**
    ///   `str(1e-05)` is `'1e-05'` (Python: `ValueError`) but
    ///   `BigDecimal::from_str("1e-05")` is scale 5, indistinguishable from
    ///   `Decimal("0.00001")` (Python: "siro piso"), and this returns the
    ///   latter for both. Likewise `Decimal("1E+2")` is scale -2, which
    ///   `Display` renders "100", so this returns "gatos piso" where Python
