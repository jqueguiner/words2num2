//! Port of `lang_TH.py` (Thai). Registry key `"th"` → `Num2Word_TH`
//! (verified in `num2words2/__init__.py`).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_TH` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` and
//! *does* define `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so Python's
//! `__init__` builds `self.cards` and sets `MAXVAL` — but every one of those
//! is dead code, because TH overrides `to_cardinal` outright and drives its
//! own `left_num_to_text` → `split_six` → `splitnum` → `add_text_million`
//! pipeline. `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` therefore stay at their trait defaults
//! here, and there is **no overflow check** at any size (see bug 1 below).
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` (unchanged by TH, so the trait defaults do
//! the right thing):
//!   * `to_ordinal_num(value) -> value`  → default `Ok(value.to_string())`.
//!     Corpus confirms `to_ordinal_num(-1)` == "-1" (no sign handling, no
//!     ordinal suffix — Python literally returns the input unchanged and the
//!     dispatcher stringifies it).
//!   * `to_year(value) -> self.to_cardinal(value)` → default delegates through
//!     `&self`, picking up the `to_cardinal` override below. There is no BC/AD
//!     handling whatsoever: `to_year(-500)` == "ติดลบห้าร้อย" ("minus five
//!     hundred"), verified against the interpreter.
//!
//! # Thai numeral system, as this module models it
//!
//! Thai groups by **six** digits (ล้าน = 10^6), not three, and stacks the
//! ล้าน marker for higher powers: 10^12 is "million million"
//! (หนึ่งล้านล้าน), 10^18 is "million million million". `split_six` chops the
//! digit string into 6-digit groups, and `add_text_million` rejoins them with
//! a literal "ล้าน" between each. This scales indefinitely, which is why the
//! absent overflow check never actually bites.
//!
//! Two morphological rules live in `splitnum`:
//!   * **เอ็ด** — a trailing 1 in a multi-digit group is "et", not "one"
//!     (11 → สิบเอ็ด, 21 → ยี่สิบเอ็ด, 101 → หนึ่งร้อยเอ็ด).
//!   * **ยี่** — 2 in the tens place is "yi", not "song" (20 → ยี่สิบ).
//!   * A bare 1 in the tens place gets no unit word at all (10 → สิบ, not
//!     "หนึ่งสิบ"), via the `index != 1 or num != 1` guard.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python quirks
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. All of the following are verified against
//! the interpreter and preserved verbatim:
//!
//! 1. **`cards` is garbage and `MAXVAL` is 9000.** TH's `low_numwords` is
//!    listed *ascending* (ศูนย์=0 … เก้า=9), but `Num2Word_Base.set_low_numwords`
//!    assumes *descending* and zips against `range(len-1, -1, -1)`. The
//!    resulting table maps `cards[9] = "ศูนย์"` ("zero"), `cards[8] = "หนึ่ง"`
//!    ("one"), … `cards[0] = "เก้า"` ("nine") — every entry inverted. `MAXVAL`
//!    is then `1000 * 9 == 9000`. None of this is ever read, because
//!    `to_cardinal` is overridden and never calls `splitnum`(base)/`clean`/
//!    `merge`. Reproduced here only by *omission*: we leave `cards`/`maxval`
//!    at their trait defaults rather than modelling a table nothing consults.
//!    The consequence that *is* observable: TH never raises `OverflowError`,
//!    at any magnitude (corpus goes to 10^21 and returns fine).
//!
//! 2. **Three hardcoded string special-cases in `left_num_to_text`**, compared
//!    against the *decimal string*, not the value:
//!      * `"100"` → "ร้อย"   (the pipeline would emit "หนึ่งร้อย")
//!      * `"100000000"` → "ร้อยล้าน"   (pipeline: "หนึ่งร้อยล้าน")
//!      * `"1000000000"` → "พันล้าน"   (pipeline: "หนึ่งพันล้าน")
//!    These drop the leading "หนึ่ง" ("one") for exactly three magnitudes and
//!    nothing else, which is inconsistent: 1000 stays "หนึ่งพัน", 10^6 stays
//!    "หนึ่งล้าน", 10^12 stays "หนึ่งล้านล้าน". Colloquial Thai does drop the
//!    "one" here, so it is arguably a partial fix rather than a bug — but it
//!    is applied to a string, so it fires *after* the minus sign is stripped:
//!    `to_cardinal(-100)` == "ติดลบร้อย" (corpus-confirmed), and it fires only
//!    on the whole number, never on an internal group (1000100 is unaffected).
//!    Modelled by [`left_num_to_text`].
//!
//! 3. **`length` is a `bool` compared against `0`.** `splitnum` does
//!    `length = len(six_num) > 1` and later tests `length == 0`, which in
//!    Python is `False == 0` → `True`. It means "this group is a single
//!    digit". Ported as `!length`.
//!
//! 4. **`word_num += "เอ็ด"` appends where every sibling branch prepends.**
//!    Harmless in practice: the branch is guarded by `index == 0`, and at
//!    index 0 the `if index:` prefix never ran, so `word_num` is always empty
//!    there. Ported literally regardless.
//!
//! 5. **Zero-suppression asymmetry.** A group of all zeros yields `""`, and
//!    `add_text_million` still welds "ล้าน" onto it — which is exactly how
//!    10^6 becomes "หนึ่งล้าน" (`"หนึ่ง" + "ล้าน" + ""`). Only a *single-digit*
//!    group of "0" produces the word ศูนย์, so the string "0" is the sole way
//!    to ever see it in an integer result.
//!
//! # The currency surface
//!
//! `Num2Word_TH` overrides `to_currency` **wholesale** and shares almost
//! nothing with `Num2Word_Base`'s version — no `pluralize`, no `has_decimal`
//! guard, no `CURRENCY_PRECISION`, no adjective support, and its own
//! `NotImplementedError` wording. See [`LangTh::to_currency`] for the
//! divergences, each of which is corpus- or interpreter-confirmed.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is **not** overridden: TH inherits `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque`
//! verbatim, so the trait default (`currency::default_to_cheque`) is left in
//! place and only `lang_name` + `currency_forms` are supplied for it to read.
//! That inheritance is why the two error messages differ — see
//! [`LangTh::to_currency`].
//!
//! `round_2_decimal` is **dead library code**: `lang_TH.py` defines it, but no
//! conversion path calls it (`to_currency` inlines its own rounding via
//! `parse_currency_parts`). Only `tests/lang/test_th.py` pokes it directly, and
//! it is unreachable from every `to_*` entry point the dispatcher exposes, so
//! it is deliberately not ported.
//!
//! # The float / Decimal cardinal path
//!
//! `Num2Word_TH.to_cardinal` is a single method covering *both* integer and
//! non-integer input. The integer half (above) leaves `post == "0"` and skips
//! the "จุด" branch — provably dead for `int` input, since `float2tuple` on an
//! `int` returns `post == 0` with `self.precision = 0`. Float and `Decimal`
//! input open that branch instead.
//!
//! The trait splits the one Python method in two: [`to_cardinal`] takes the
//! `BigInt` path, and the trait hook [`LangTh::to_cardinal_float`] takes the
//! `FloatValue` path. Both run the same `left_num_to_text` pipeline and the
//! same "จุด" + per-digit `low_numwords` rendering, shared through
//! [`cardinal_float_from_value`]. TH never delegates to
//! `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal_float`, which is why the byte shape differs from
//! the base's — no spaces, no titled pointword ("หนึ่งจุดหนึ่ง", not
//! "หนึ่ง จุด หนึ่ง") — and why the trait's `cardinal_from_decimal` default is
//! left unused.
//!
//! The *currency* fractional-cents branch reaches the same rendering by a
//! separate door — Python's `self.to_cardinal(float(right))` — ported as the
//! f64-only [`to_cardinal_float`] free helper that [`LangTh::to_currency`]
//! calls. It is kept distinct from the `FloatValue` core only because the
//! subunits it sees are always in `[0, 100)`, so it can safely recompute
//! precision from `repr` (see [`cardinal_float_from_value`] for why the general
//! path cannot).
//!
//! # Cross-call mutable state
//!
//! `float2tuple` writes `self.precision` (to 0 for integer input) and
//! `to_cardinal` reads it back on the next line. It is a genuine
//! write-then-read handshake on instance state, but it is confined to a single
//! call and, for integer input, the value it computes is never used — `post`
//! is `"0"` and the padding branch `len(post) < precision` is `1 < 0`, i.e.
//! false. No state survives a call, so the stateless Rust path is safe here.

///     (Rust `repr` precision 0), yet Python's `str(1e21)` is `"1e+21"` →
///     precision 21, so `num2words(1e21, lang="th")` renders the integer then
