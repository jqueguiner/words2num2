//! Port of `lang_AM.py` (Amharic).
//!
//! Registry check: `CONVERTER_CLASSES["am"]` → `lang_AM.Num2Word_AM()`, which
//! is the class ported here.
//!
//! Shape: **engine**. `Num2Word_AM` subclasses `lang_EUR.Num2Word_EUR` →
//! `Num2Word_Base`, defines `mid_numwords`/`low_numwords` + `merge`, and lets
//! the base `splitnum`/`clean` machinery drive the fold. `to_cardinal` *is*
//! overridden, but only to bolt two things onto the base algorithm (the
//! negative-recursion form and the `value == 100` special case) — the
//! splitnum/clean core is still the engine, so `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` are
//! all live here.
//!
//! # Inheritance chain, resolved
//!
//! * `Num2Word_EUR.setup()` builds `self.high_numwords` from the Latin illion
//!   prefixes. **AM's `set_high_numwords` ignores its `high` argument
//!   entirely**, so none of that reaches `cards` — `gen_high_numwords` is dead
//!   code for this language and is deliberately not ported.
//! * `Num2Word_EUR.set_high_numwords` (the `word + GIGA_SUFFIX` routine that
//!   would emit mixed-script tokens like "trሚሊዮን") is fully overridden. The
//!   Python source comments on this explicitly.
//! * `Num2Word_Base.__init__` → `set_numwords()` calls `set_high_numwords`
//!   *first*, and AM's version does `self.cards.clear()` before populating.
//!   Since mid/low are inserted afterwards, the clear is harmless — but it
//!   does mean `cards` holds *exactly* the 10 high entries below plus mid+low,
//!   with no 10^36+ rungs. Hence `MAXVAL = 1000 * 10**33 = 10**36`.
//! * `Num2Word_Base.verify_ordinal` supplies the `TypeError` on negatives.
//! * `Num2Word_Base.to_splitnum` / `inflect` drive `to_year`'s second branch.
//!
//! * `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal_float` / `float2tuple` are **not** overridden
//!   anywhere in AM's chain, so the float/Decimal path is the base one and
//!   [`Lang::to_cardinal_float`]'s default ([`crate::floatpath`]) already
//!   serves it. See "Float and Decimal input" below for why that is enough.
//!
//! * `Num2Word_EUR.pluralize` (`forms[0 if n == 1 else 1]`) and
//!   `Num2Word_EUR.CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` are inherited as-is. `CURRENCY_FORMS`
//!   is *not*: AM shadows it with its own three-code table, so the
//!   `Num2Word_EN.__init__` mutation that rewrites `Num2Word_EUR`'s shared
//!   class dict in place never reaches AM. Verified against the live
//!   interpreter — `Num2Word_AM.CURRENCY_FORMS is Num2Word_EUR.CURRENCY_FORMS`
//!   is `False`, and the table holds exactly ETB/USD/JPY. Every other code
//!   (EUR and GBP included) raises NotImplementedError.
//! * `CURRENCY_PRECISION` resolves to `Num2Word_Base`'s empty dict, so
//!   `.get(code, 100)` is 100 for every code and the trait's default
//!   `currency_precision` already matches. Not overridden here.
//!
//! # Float and Decimal input
//!
//! **No `to_cardinal_float` override belongs here.** AM reaches the float path
//! through its `to_cardinal` override, whose dispatch is byte-for-byte the one
//! `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal` already performs:
//!
//! ```python
//! try:
//!     assert int(value) == value
//! except (ValueError, TypeError, AssertionError):
//!     return self.to_cardinal_float(value)
//! ```
//!
//! So AM only *looks* like one of the 146 languages that hand-roll float
//! handling inside `to_cardinal`; it delegates to the untouched
//! `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal_float`, and the trait default over
//! [`crate::floatpath::default_to_cardinal_float`] is that method. The two
//! places AM's override actually diverges from Base — the negword recursion
//! and the `value == 100` short-circuit — are both reached *through* the float
//! path, because `to_cardinal_float` calls back into `self.to_cardinal(pre)`
//! for the integral part and once per fractional digit. That callback is a
//! virtual dispatch in Python and a trait dispatch here, so both land on AM's
//! override and both quirks survive:
//!
//! * `100.5` → "መቶ ነጥብ አምስት", *not* "አንድ መቶ ነጥብ አምስት" — the `== 100`
//!   short-circuit fires on `pre`. (Corpus-confirmed; contrast quirk 1, where
//!   a nested 100 keeps its "አንድ".) `-100.5` → "ሰልቢ መቶ ነጥብ አምስት" likewise.
//! * `-12.34` → "ሰልቢ አሥራ ሁለት ነጥብ ሦስት አራት" via `to_cardinal(-12)` recursing.
//!   Base would have produced the identical string through `"%s " %
//!   negword.strip()`, since AM's negword is "ሰልቢ " — trailing space included.
//! * `-0.5` → "ሰልቢ ዜሮ ነጥብ አምስት" comes from the *other* sign path:
//!   `int(-0.5) == 0` carries no minus, so `to_cardinal_float`'s own
//!   `if value < 0 and pre == 0` prepends `negword.strip()`. AM's recursion is
//!   never reached here.
//!
//! `0.0` and `1.0` never see this path at all: `int(0.0) == 0.0` holds, the
//! assert passes, and they take the integer branch — hence corpus rows "0.0" →
//! "ዜሮ" and "1.0" → "አንድ" with no "ነጥብ". Reaching `to_cardinal_float(2.0)`
//! *directly* does yield "ሁለት ነጥብ ዜሮ", which is why the entry test below pins
//! it separately from the dispatcher's behaviour.
//!
//! The f64 artefacts `float2tuple` depends on are load-bearing and are the
//! shared port's business, not AM's — `2.675` reaches it as
//! `674.9999999999998` and is rescued to `675` by the `< 0.01` heuristic, so
//! AM prints "ሁለት ነጥብ ስድስት ሰባት አምስት". Likewise the Float/Decimal split is
//! observable here: `98746251323029.99` ends "…ዘጠኝ ስምንት" as an f64 (its repr
//! is already `…029.98`) but "…ዘጠኝ ዘጠኝ" as a `Decimal`. Both are pinned below.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python quirks
//!
//! All of these are what the interpreter actually emits and are confirmed
//! against the frozen corpus. They are preserved verbatim, not fixed:
//!
//! 1. **`to_cardinal(100)` == "መቶ", but 100 nested inside a larger number is
//!    "አንድ መቶ".** The `if value == 100` short-circuit in `to_cardinal` only
//!    fires at top level; `merge` reaches its `rnum > lnum` arm for the
//!    (1, 100) pair and prefixes "አንድ". So `100` → "መቶ" while `1100` →
//!    "አንድ ሺህ አንድ መቶ" and `101` → "አንድ መቶ አንድ". Corpus-confirmed.
//! 2. **`low_numwords` has a typo at 16**: "አስራ ስድስት" — every other teen uses
//!    "አሥራ" (with ሥ), 16 alone uses "አስራ" (with ስ). Kept verbatim, so
//!    `to_cardinal(16)` == "አስራ ስድስት" and `to_ordinal(16)` == "አስራ ስድስተኛ".
//!    Note `ords` *does* contain the correctly-spelled "አሥራ ስድስት" key — which
//!    never matches anything (see 3).
//! 3. **The 9 multi-word `ords` keys are unreachable dead entries.**
//!    `to_ordinal` looks the suffix up as `outwords[-1].split("-")[-1]`, i.e. a
//!    single *space-delimited* token, so keys like "አሥራ አንድ" (which contain a
//!    space) can never be hit. They are retained here for table fidelity. The
//!    output is unaffected: 11 → "አሥራ አንደኛ" either way, because the fallback
//!    path ordinalises just the trailing "አንድ" → "አንደኛ".
//! 4. **`to_ordinal` splits on "-" but re-joins with " ".** EN joins back with
//!    "-"; AM uses `" ".join(lastwords)`. Latent, not observable: AM's `merge`
//!    never emits a hyphen, so `lastwords` always has exactly one element and
//!    the join is a no-op. Reproduced anyway — see [`LangAm::to_ordinal`].
//! 5. **`exclude_title` lists "አሉታዊ" but `negword` is "ሰልቢ ".** The exclusion
//!    list can therefore never protect the negative word. Moot in practice:
//!    `is_title` is `False` in `Num2Word_Base.__init__` and *nothing* in the
//!    library ever sets it True, so `title()` is unconditionally the identity.
//!    Both fields are carried over for completeness.
//! 6. **`to_year` on negatives leans on Python's floor `//` and `%`.**
//!    `to_year(-44)` == "ሰልቢ አንድ መቶ አምሳ ስድስት" — literally "negative one
//!    hundred fifty six" for the year 44 BC. This falls out of
//!    `divmod(-44, 100) == (-1, 56)`: the high part renders as `to_cardinal(-1)`
//!    → "ሰልቢ አንድ" and the low part as the *positive* 56. Rust's `/` and `%`
//!    truncate toward zero and would give `(0, -44)` instead, so this port uses
//!    `div_mod_floor`/`div_floor`/`mod_floor` throughout. Corpus-confirmed.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python quirks — currency
//!
//! 7. **`CURRENCY_FORMS` entries are 3-tuples, not 2-tuples.** Every other
//!    table in the library is `(unit_forms, subunit_forms)`; AM's carries a
//!    third element, a per-currency default separator (`" ከ"`). See
//!    `AmCurrency`. This single shape difference drives quirks 8 and 9.
//! 8. **`to_cheque` is dead for Amharic — every call raises.** AM does not
//!    override it, and the inherited `Num2Word_Base.to_cheque` opens with
//!    `cr1, _cr2 = self.CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` inside a `try` that catches
//!    only `KeyError`. Against a 3-tuple that unpack raises `ValueError:
//!    too many values to unpack (expected 2)`, which sails straight through
//!    the handler. So the currency code only selects *which* exception:
//!    ETB/USD/JPY → ValueError, everything else → NotImplementedError. The
//!    corpus pins both halves (`cheque:USD` → ValueError, `cheque:EUR` →
//!    NotImplementedError). See [`LangAm::to_cheque`].
//! 9. **`to_currency` ignores `CURRENCY_PRECISION` and hardcodes 100.** The
//!    divisor is the literal `100` in `has_fractional_cents`, and
//!    `parse_currency_parts` is called without a `divisor=` kwarg, taking its
//!    100 default. JPY therefore renders sen — `12.34 JPY` → "…ከ ሠላሳ አራት ሴን"
//!    — where `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` would consult the precision table
//!    and skip the subunit for a 0-decimal currency. Moot in practice, since
//!    AM's `CURRENCY_PRECISION` is empty anyway, but the two would diverge if
//!    it ever gained an entry. Corpus-confirmed.
//! 10. **`to_currency` accepts `adjective` and never reads it.** The parameter
//!    is in the signature but the body has no `if adjective:` branch, so
//!    `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` — inherited intact from EUR — is unreachable
//!    through this language. `adjective=True` changes nothing. The table is
//!    still exposed via [`Lang::currency_adjective`] for data fidelity, the
//!    same way the dead `ords` entries are kept above.
//! 11. **A caller-supplied `separator=","` is silently overridden.** The guard
//!    is `if separator == ","`, a *value* test, not an "was the kwarg omitted"
//!    test — so passing the base default explicitly still swaps in `" ከ"`.
//! 12. **A custom separator double-spaces.** The format string is
//!    `"%s%s %s%s %s %s"`: the separator is glued to the unit word with no
//!    space and followed by `" %s"`. AM's own `" ከ"` is written with a leading
//!    space to compensate, so `separator=" ና "` yields `"… ብር ና  ሠላሳ አራት …"`
//!    with two spaces. Falls out of the format string; not special-cased.
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! * `to_ordinal`/`to_ordinal_num` on a negative → `verify_ordinal` raises
//!   `TypeError` → [`N2WError::Type`]. Corpus-confirmed for -1, -7, -21, -42,
//!   -100, -999, -1000, -1000000.
//! * `to_cardinal(v)` for `v >= 10**36` → `OverflowError` → [`N2WError::Overflow`].
//!   (Not exercised by the corpus; the largest case is 10^21.)
//! * `to_currency(v, "<unknown>")` → `NotImplementedError` →
//!   [`N2WError::NotImplemented`]. Raised *before* `to_cardinal` runs, so
//!   `to_currency(10**40, "EUR")` is NotImplementedError while
//!   `to_currency(10**40, "USD")` is OverflowError. The ordering is preserved.
//! * `to_cheque(v, "ETB"|"USD"|"JPY")` → `ValueError` → [`N2WError::Value`]
//!   (quirk 8). Any other code → `NotImplementedError`.
