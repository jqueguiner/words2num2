//! Port of `lang_LO.py` (Lao).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_LO` subclasses `Num2Word_Base`, but its
//! `setup()` defines only `negword`, `pointword` and an `ones` list — no
//! `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`. The `any(hasattr(...))` guard
//! in `Num2Word_Base.__init__` therefore never fires, so Python never builds
//! `self.cards` and never sets `self.MAXVAL`. `to_cardinal` is overridden
//! outright and drives `_int_to_word`, a plain recursive descent over the Lao
//! myriad-style scale (สิบ/ຊາວ/ຮ້ອຍ/ພັນ/ໝື່ນ/ແສນ/ລ້ານ).
//!
//! Consequently `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and
//! there is **no overflow check at all** — see bug 1 below for what happens
//! instead.
//!
//! Inherited from `Num2Word_Base` and *not* overridden by LO:
//!   * `to_cheque` — the only inherited method that runs. It reads
//!     `CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` *strictly* (`KeyError` -> `NotImplementedError`)
//!     and `_money_verbose` -> `to_cardinal`, both of which the trait defaults
//!     already provide. See bug 5 for the contradiction this creates with LO's
//!     own `to_currency`.
//!   * `verify_ordinal` is inherited but **never called**, which is why
//!     negatives sail through `to_ordinal` (bug 2).
//!   * `pluralize`, `_cents_verbose` and `_cents_terse` are all unreachable —
//!     LO's `to_currency` never calls them and `to_cheque` does not either — so
//!     their trait defaults (`pluralize` raises) are deliberately left alone.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `CURRENCY_FORMS` is defined on `Num2Word_LO` itself (LAK/USD/EUR), so none of
//! the `lang_EUR`/`Num2Word_EN` shared-dict mutation described in
//! `PORTING_CURRENCY.md` applies here — the live interpreter confirms exactly
//! those three codes. `CURRENCY_PRECISION` and `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` are both
//! empty (`{}`), so every code is divisor 100 and no adjective exists; the trait
//! defaults cover both and neither hook is overridden.
//!
//! `to_currency` is overridden outright and shares no code with
//! `Num2Word_Base.to_currency`: no `parse_currency_parts`, no divisor, no
//! `pluralize`. It re-splits `str(val)` by hand.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. Each of the following is wrong-looking but is
//! exactly what Python emits, and each is pinned by the frozen corpus:
//!
//! 1. **`_int_to_word` gives up at 10^9 and returns the decimal digits.** The
//!    final `else` arm is `return str(number)`, so `to_cardinal(10**9)` is the
//!    ASCII string `"1000000000"`, not Lao words. Every value >= 10^9 is echoed
//!    back as digits, forever — there is no `OverflowError` and no upper bound.
//!    Corpus confirms this out to 10^21. See [`LangLo::int_to_word`].
//! 2. **`to_ordinal` never calls `verify_ordinal`**, so negatives are accepted
//!    and produce `"ທີ່" + to_cardinal(n)` — e.g. `to_ordinal(-1)` ==
//!    `"ທີ່ລົບ ໜຶ່ງ"` ("th-minus one"). Most languages raise `TypeError` here.
//! 3. **`to_ordinal`/`to_ordinal_num` are pure prefixing** — the "ordinal" is
//!    just `"ທີ່"` glued onto the cardinal (or onto `str(number)`), with no
//!    separator and no morphology. So `to_ordinal(10**9)` == `"ທີ່1000000000"`,
//!    inheriting bug 1.
//! 4. **`negword` carries a trailing space** (`"ລົບ "`, not `"ລົບ"`), unlike the
//!    base class's convention of stripping it at the call site. `to_cardinal`
//!    concatenates it raw, which happens to give the right single space —
//!    but it means [`Lang::negword`] here returns a *space-suffixed* word, so a
//!    caller applying the base's usual `"%s " % negword.strip()` idiom would
//!    get the same result only by coincidence. `to_currency` concatenates it
//!    raw too.
//! 5. **`to_currency` and `to_cheque` disagree about unknown currency codes.**
//!    LO's `to_currency` looks the code up *leniently* —
//!    `CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, self.CURRENCY_FORMS["LAK"])` — so an
//!    unimplemented code silently renders in **Lao kip**, while the inherited
//!    `to_cheque` does a strict `CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` and raises
//!    `NotImplementedError` for the very same code. The corpus pins both halves:
//!    `currency:GBP` -> `"ສິບສອງ ກີບ ສາມສິບສີ່ ອັດ"` (kip/at, not pounds/pence)
//!    while `cheque:GBP` -> `NotImplementedError`. Same for JPY, KWD, BHD, INR,
//!    CNY and CHF. See [`LangLo::to_currency`].
//! 6. **`to_currency` ignores `CURRENCY_PRECISION` entirely.** It hardcodes a
//!    two-digit subunit via `parts[1][:2]`, so the 3-decimal (KWD/BHD) and
//!    0-decimal (JPY) currencies get plain hundredths like everything else —
//!    and since those codes are not in `CURRENCY_FORMS` anyway they land on the
//!    LAK fallback first. `currency:JPY` of `0.5` is `"ສູນ ກີບ ຫ້າສິບ ອັດ"`, not
//!    the whole-unit rounding `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` would apply. LO's
//!    `CURRENCY_PRECISION` is `{}` regardless, so `to_cheque` uses 100.
//! 7. **A float with zero cents drops the cents segment.** The guard is
//!    `if cents and right`, and `right` is an int, so `1.0` (which yields
//!    `right = 0`) renders `"ໜຶ່ງ ເອີໂຣ"` — identical to the int `1`.
//!    `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` would emit a "zero cents" tail here. The
//!    int/float distinction is still threaded through faithfully (see
//!    [`split_currency`]) because it only *coincidentally* collapses in LO's
//!    output.
//! 8. **`cents=False` omits the cents rather than making them terse**, because
//!    the same `cents and right` guard suppresses the whole segment instead of
//!    switching to `_cents_terse` the way the base class does.
//! 9. **`adjective` is accepted and completely ignored** — declared in the
//!    signature, never read, and `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` is empty anyway.
//! 10. **Subunits are truncated, not rounded.** `parts[1][:2]` slices the
//!    decimal string, so `12.349` gives 34 cents (not 35) and `0.001` gives 0.
//!
//! # Non-bugs that look like bugs
//!
//! * The trailing `.strip()` in `to_cardinal` is a no-op for integer input:
//!   every `_int_to_word` arm returns a non-empty, non-padded string and the
//!   only prefix is `""` or `"ລົບ "`. Reproduced anyway ([`str::trim`]) so the
//!   port matches the source line for line.
//! * The `if number < 0` arm of `_int_to_word` is **dead code** on the four
//!   in-scope entry points: `to_cardinal` strips the sign before calling, and
//!   every recursive call passes a non-negative quotient or remainder. It is
//!   reachable only from `to_currency` (out of scope). Ported regardless.
//! * `to_cardinal`'s `"." in n` branch (the `pointword` per-digit path) is
//!   unreachable from `BigInt` input — `str(int)` never contains a dot. The
//!   `BigInt` `to_cardinal` above therefore only runs the integer `else` branch.
//!   The dotted branch *is* ported, in [`LangLo::to_cardinal_float`]: because
//!   `Num2Word_LO` overrides `to_cardinal` and handles non-integers inline via
//!   `str(number)` string-splitting — nothing like `Num2Word_Base`'s
//!   `float2tuple` — the trait's default `to_cardinal_float` is wrong for LO and
//!   is overridden. See that method for the full port and its consequences.
//!
//! # Float routing: every float/Decimal goes through the string surgery
//!
//! `to_cardinal` branches on `"." in str(number)`, never on
//! `int(value) == value`, so a *whole* float still reads its trailing zero:
//! `to_cardinal(5.0)` == `"ຫ້າ ຈຸດ ສູນ"` and `Decimal("5.00")` reads two zero
//! digits, while a point-free `Decimal("5")` takes the integer reading. The
//! base trait's `cardinal_float_entry` (whole -> int path) is therefore
//! overridden to send **all** float/Decimal input through the cascade;
//! `to_ordinal`/`to_year` float entries prefix that same output
//! (`"ທີ່"`/`"ປີ "`), and `to_ordinal_num`'s float entry prefixes the
//! binding-provided `str(value)`.
//!
//! `str(number)` is rebuilt exactly: `str(Decimal)` via
//! [`crate::strnum::python_decimal_str`] (trailing zeros and exponent forms
//! kept — `"5.00"`, `"1E+2"`), and `str(float)` via [`py_float_str`], which
//! mirrors CPython's shortest-repr formatting *including* the switch to
//! exponent form at `|v| >= 1e16` or `0 < |v| < 1e-4`. Exponential text then
//! fails in `int()` exactly as Python's does: `int("1e+16")` / `int("1E+2")`
//! raise ValueError (no dot in the repr), and a mantissa-dotted `1.23e+16`
//! dies on `int("e")` in the digit walk. `Decimal("-0.0")` arrives as
//! `FloatValue::Float { -0.0 }` (the binding converts it — `BigDecimal` has
//! no signed zero) and the sign bit keeps the negword:
//! `"ລົບ ສູນ ຈຸດ ສູນ"`, as pinned.
//!
//! # String input: Infinity/NaN raise ValueError, not OverflowError
//!
//! `num2words("Infinity", lang="lo")` parses to `Decimal("Infinity")` and
//! lands in this `to_cardinal`: `str()` gives `"Infinity"` — no `"."` — and
//! `int("Infinity")` raises **ValueError**. The binding would otherwise map
//! `ParsedNumber::Inf` to the base path's OverflowError before any LO code
//! runs, so [`Lang::str_to_number`] intercepts Inf (and NaN, whose binding
//! message differs from `int("NaN")`'s). Known gap (unpinned): Python's
//! `to_ordinal_num(Decimal("Infinity"))` echoes `"ທີ່Infinity"`, which the
//! entry-level interception turns into the cardinal path's ValueError; the
//! strings corpus pins Infinity/NaN under `to=cardinal` only.
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! **The four integer modes raise nothing.** No `MAXVAL` check, no dict lookups,
//! no list indexing that can run out of range (every `ones[...]` index is pinned
//! to 0..=9 by the branch guard that precedes it), and no `int()` of a
//! non-numeric token. Every *integer* corpus row for `lo` in those modes is
//! `"ok": true`. The float/Decimal side of cardinal/ordinal/year raises
//! `Value` — Python's ValueError from `int()` — exactly when `str(number)`
//! is exponential (see the float-routing section above).
//!
//! The currency surface has exactly two:
//!
//! * `NotImplemented` — from the inherited `to_cheque` only, on a code outside
//!   {LAK, USD, EUR}. Message: `Currency code "X" not implemented for
//!   "Num2Word_LO"`. **`to_currency` cannot raise it** (bug 5).
//! * `Value` — from `int()` on an exponent-notation token inside
//!   [`split_currency`]; see that function for the exact conditions and the one
//!   known gap.

///   is already non-negative here, so truncation is the floor.
/// * `int(parts[1][:2].ljust(2, "0"))` is `floor(frac * 100)`. The `[:2]`
///   truncation and the `ljust` zero-padding are both subsumed: the scale
///   carries `"1.0"`'s trailing zero, and truncating at two places is what

/// | `"0.001"` | `"00"` | 0  | 0  |
/// | `"0.567"` | `"56"` | 56 | 56 |
///
/// `parts[0]` is never `""` and `parts[1]` is never `""` for any string Python's
/// `str()` produces, so the two `else 0` fallbacks are dead; they coincide with
/// the arithmetic anyway.
///
/// # The exponent-notation `ValueError`
///
/// `str()` switches to exponent notation for a float outside roughly
/// `1e-4 <= |v| < 1e16`, and `int()` chokes on the resulting token:
/// `str(1e16)` is `"1e+16"`, `parts` is `["1e+16"]`, and `int("1e+16")` raises
/// **`ValueError`** — not `NotImplementedError`, and not anything LO catches. So
/// `to_currency` raises for large floats rather than returning a string.
///
/// The check below keys off the *representation*, which is what Python's
/// `str().split(".")` does too, so it stays faithful for the `Decimal` inputs the
/// shim also accepts: `Decimal("1E+3")` stringifies with an exponent and raises,
/// while `Decimal(1000)` stringifies as plain digits and succeeds — and the two
/// parse to different scales (-3 vs 0), so both land correctly.
///
/// A **positive** exponent is therefore recoverable: plain decimal notation can
/// never yield a negative `BigDecimal` scale, so `scale < 0` proves `str()`
/// emitted an exponent. No false positives are possible.
///
/// Two exponent cases are **not** recoverable. Both are flagged in the port
/// report rather than papered over, and no corpus row exercises either.
///
/// 1. *Negative exponent.* `str(1e-05)` is `"1e-05"` (CPython goes scientific
///    below `1e-4`) and raises `ValueError`, but it parses to the very same
///    `(1, scale=5)` as `Decimal("0.00001")`, which stringifies as `"0.00001"`
///    and does *not* raise — Python returns `"ສູນ ເອີໂຣ"` for it. The two are
///    indistinguishable once across the boundary, so a float `< 1e-4` returns
///    `(0, 0)` here (`"ສູນ ເອີໂຣ"`) where Python raises. Discriminating on the
///    value instead (`|v| < 1e-4`) would fix the float and break the `Decimal`,
///    so the representation-faithful rule is kept.
///
/// 2. *Exponent absorbed by the mantissa's own digits.* When a float's repr
///    carries at least as many fractional digits as its exponent the scale
///    comes out `>= 0` and no error fires — but Python does not error either.
///    It splits the **exponent string** on the dot and parses the pieces:
///    `str(1.2345678901234568e+16).split(".")` is
///    `["1", "2345678901234568e+16"]`, so `left = int("1") = 1` and
///    `right = int("23") = 23`, giving `"ໜຶ່ງ ເອີໂຣ ຊາວສາມ ເຊັນ"` — one euro
///    and twenty-three cents for a value of ~1.2e16. This port instead reads
///    the number it was handed and returns `"12345678901234568 ເອີໂຣ"` (bug 1's
///    digit echo). Reproducing Python's answer would mean re-deriving
