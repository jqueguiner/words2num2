//! Port of `lang_BA.py` (Bashkir).
//!
//! Registry check: `CONVERTER_CLASSES["ba"] = lang_BA.Num2Word_BA()`
//! (`__init__.py:332`), so `Num2Word_BA` is the class this key resolves to.
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_BA` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`. `base.py`'s
//! `__init__` only builds `self.cards` / sets `self.MAXVAL` when one of those
//! three attributes exists, so for Bashkir **neither is ever created**:
//! `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here and are never
//! consulted. There is consequently **no overflow check at all** — `to_cardinal`
//! is overridden outright and recurses over `_int_to_word`, which is total for
//! every integer (see "unbounded recursion" below).
//!
//! `setup()` overrides two inherited attributes:
//!   * `negword  = "минус "`  (note the **trailing space**, see below)
//!   * `pointword = "өтөр"`
//!
//! All four in-scope modes are overridden by `Num2Word_BA`; nothing is
//! inherited from `Num2Word_Base` except the attributes above. In particular
//! `to_ordinal` does **not** call `verify_ordinal`, so negative ordinals are
//! accepted rather than raising (`to_ordinal(-1)` == "минус бер-се").
//!
//! # No error paths
//!
//! For integer input this language cannot raise. Every list index is guarded by
//! a range check that bounds it to 0..=9, and `_int_to_word` is never reached
//! with 0 from a recursive call (each recursion site tests the remainder for
//! truthiness first), so the unreachable `ones[0] == ""` slot never surfaces.
//!
//! The **float path** does add one: `Value` (Python `ValueError`), raised when
//! `str(number)` comes out in exponent notation and Bashkir feeds that text to
//! `int()`. See [`float_str`] and [`py_int`].
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python quirks
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. The following look wrong but are exactly what
//! Python emits, verified against the frozen corpus:
//!
//! 1. **The scale table stops at "миллиард" (10^9) and then recurses.** The
//!    final `else` arm divides by 10^9 and calls `_int_to_word` on the quotient
//!    with no further scale words, so large values stack "миллиард" onto a
//!    recursively-built multiplier instead of naming higher scales:
//!      * 10^12 → "бер мең миллиард"          (lit. "one thousand milliard")
//!      * 10^15 → "бер миллион миллиард"
//!      * 10^18 → "бер миллиард миллиард"
//!      * 10^21 → "бер мең миллиард миллиард"
//!    All four are corpus rows. This makes `_int_to_word` **unbounded** — it
//!    terminates for any BigInt (the quotient shrinks by 10^9 each step) rather
//!    than raising `OverflowError`, so the value must stay a `BigInt` here.
//! 2. **`negword` is used raw, not stripped.** Bashkir's `to_cardinal` does
//!    `ret = self.negword` and concatenates directly, unlike
//!    `Num2Word_Base.to_cardinal` which does `"%s " % self.negword.strip()`.
//!    The two happen to agree because `negword` is exactly `"минус "`, but the
//!    trailing space is load-bearing and is preserved verbatim in [`NEGWORD`].
//! 3. **`to_ordinal` glues the suffix onto the bare cardinal**, giving the
//!    invariant suffix "-се" regardless of the final word's phonology —
//!    "нуль-се", "ун бер-се", "туғыҙ-се". No stem changes, no vowel harmony.
//! 4. **`to_ordinal_num` never validates**, so it emits "0-се" and "-1-се".
//! 5. **Hundreds are always explicit**: 100 → "бер йөҙ" ("one hundred"), never
//!    a bare "йөҙ". Likewise 1000 → "бер мең". Same for the recursive scales.
//!
//! # The float/Decimal path: `str()`, not `float2tuple`
//!
//! `Num2Word_BA` overrides **`to_cardinal`**, not `to_cardinal_float`, and its
//! non-integer branch never reaches `base.float2tuple`:
//!
//! ```python
//! n = str(number).strip()
//! if n.startswith("-"):
//!     n = n[1:]; ret = self.negword
//! else:
//!     ret = ""
//! if "." in n:
//!     left, right = n.split(".", 1)
//!     ret += self._int_to_word(int(left)) + " " + self.pointword + " "
//!     ret += " ".join(self._int_to_word(int(d)) for d in right)
//!     return ret
//! ```
//!
//! So the fractional digits are **the characters of `str(number)`**, not a
//! `abs(value - pre) * 10**precision` product. This has three consequences that
//! set Bashkir apart from the 26 languages inheriting `default_to_cardinal_float`:
//!
//! 1. **The f64 artefacts never arise.** `float2tuple`'s `674.9999999999998` /
//!    `< 0.01` rescue dance has no analogue here: `str(2.675)` is `"2.675"` and
//!    the digits are read straight off. The two routes happen to agree on 2.675
//!    and 1.005 — because `repr` is shortest-round-trip and the heuristic exists
//!    precisely to recover it — but they agree by coincidence, not by shared
//!    code. Nothing in this file rounds, so `round_ties_even` has no place in it.
//! 2. **`self.precision` is never read**, so the `precision=` kwarg (issue #580)
//!    is a **silent no-op** for Bashkir. `num2words(2.675, lang="ba",
//!    precision=1)` is still "ике өтөр алты ете биш", verified against the live
//!    interpreter. [`LangBa::to_cardinal_float`] therefore ignores
//!    `precision_override`, and `FloatValue::precision` with it.
//! 3. **Exponent notation raises `ValueError`.** Bashkir hands `str()`'s output
//!    to `int()` unfiltered, so any value `repr` spells with an `e` crashes:
//!    `num2words(1e16, lang="ba")` is
//!    `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1e+16'`, and
//!    `num2words(1.5e-5, lang="ba")` is `... : 'e'` — the latter from the
//!    *per-character* `int(d)` in the join, after `int("1")` has already
//!    succeeded. Both messages are reproduced verbatim.
//!
//! ## Why `str()` is reconstructed rather than passed in
//!
//! The trait hands over a [`FloatValue`], not the text Python printed, so the
//! text has to be rebuilt. That is not a re-implementation of float formatting:
//! Rust's `{:e}` and Python's `repr` both emit the *shortest round-trip* digits,
//! which is the hard part and is already solved on both sides. What is rebuilt
//! is only the **layout** — where the point goes and whether the exponent form
//! is used — which is a range check on one integer. See [`float_str`].
//!
//! `FloatValue`'s Float/Decimal split is load-bearing here for a reason beyond
//! precision: **`float` and `Decimal` stringify by different rules**, and the
//! outputs genuinely diverge.
//!
//! | value | `str()` | `to_cardinal("ba")` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `0.00001` (float) | `'1e-05'` | `ValueError` |
//! | `Decimal("0.00001")` | `'0.00001'` | нуль өтөр нуль нуль нуль нуль бер |
//!
//! `repr(float)` goes exponential outside `-4 < decpt <= 16`;
//! `Decimal.__str__` goes exponential (with a capital `E` and an *unpadded*
//! exponent) when its own exponent is positive or `leftdigits <= -6`. Collapsing
//! the two arms — or routing both through one spelling — changes real answers,
//! so [`float_str`] and [`decimal_str`] are separate ports of the two separate
//! CPython functions.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `Num2Word_BA` overrides `to_currency` **wholesale** and shares almost nothing
//! with `Num2Word_Base.to_currency`. It also defines its own three-entry
//! `CURRENCY_FORMS` (RUB/USD/EUR) and no `CURRENCY_PRECISION` /
//! `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`, so the divisor is 100 for every code.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is **not** overridden, so it comes straight from
//! `Num2Word_Base` — which means the two entry points disagree about unknown
//! currency codes, and the corpus records both halves of that split:
//!
//! * `to_currency` does `CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, CURRENCY_FORMS["RUB"])`
//!   — an unknown code **silently falls back to roubles**. `currency:GBP` on
//!   12.34 yields "ун ике **һум** һәм утыҙ дүрт **тин**", not pounds, and
//!   never raises.
//! * `to_cheque` does `CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` — an unknown code raises
//!   `NotImplementedError`. `cheque:GBP` is a corpus error row.
//!
//! So [`Lang::currency_forms`] here is the *strict* lookup (`None` for unknown,
//! which is what `default_to_cheque` needs) and the RUB fallback lives inside
//! [`LangBa::to_currency`], mirroring where Python puts it.
//!
//! Because `to_currency` is fully overridden, these inherited hooks are never
//! reached and are deliberately left at their trait defaults:
//! `pluralize` (Bashkir never calls it — `cr1[0]`/`cr2[0]` are indexed
//! directly, so the abstract `Num2Word_Base.pluralize` never fires),
//! `cents_verbose`, `cents_terse`, `currency_precision` and
//! `currency_adjective`. `money_verbose` keeps the base default
//! (`self.to_cardinal(number)`), which is what `to_cheque` calls.
//!
//! ## More reproduced Python quirks (currency)
//!
//! 6. **`self.parse_currency` does not exist.** `to_currency` opens with
//!    `try: ... self.parse_currency(val) except AttributeError:`. No class in
//!    the MRO defines `parse_currency` (`base.py` has `parse_minus` and imports
//!    `parse_currency_parts` as a free function), so the attribute lookup
//!    always raises and the `except` body is the *only* path ever taken. The
//!    `try` block is dead code; this port implements the fallback directly.
//! 7. **`adjective` and `cents=False` are near-no-ops.** `adjective` is
//!    accepted and never read. `cents=False` does not switch to terse digits
//!    the way `Num2Word_Base` does — it drops the subunit segment entirely.
//! 8. **Cents are truncated to two digits, never rounded**:
//!    `int(parts[1][:2].ljust(2, "0"))`. So `1.005` → 0 cents ("00"), `0.5` →
//!    50 cents ("5" → "50"), `0.01` → 1 cent. See [`split_currency`].
//! 9. **A float with zero cents prints no cents at all.** `1.0` → "бер евро",
//!    because the guard is `if cents and right` and `right == 0` is falsy.
//!    This is the one language where the int-vs-float split that
//!    `base.to_currency` hinges on makes **no** observable difference: `1` and
//!    `1.0` both render "бер евро". The distinction is still threaded through
//!    faithfully rather than collapsed, because it is the *value* of `right`
//!    that decides, not the type.
//!
//! # Python `//` vs Rust `/`
//!
//! `_int_to_word` is only ever entered with a non-negative value (`to_cardinal`
//! strips the "-" from the *string* before `int()`), and every recursive call
//! passes a quotient or remainder of a non-negative number. On non-negative
//! operands Python's floor-`//`/`%` and Rust's truncating-`/`/`%` coincide, so
//! plain `/` and `%` are used below.
