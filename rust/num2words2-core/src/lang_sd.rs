//! Port of `lang_SD.py` (Sindhi).
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_SD` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but its
//! `setup()` defines none of `high_numwords`/`mid_numwords`/`low_numwords`, so
//! the `any(hasattr(...))` guard in `Num2Word_Base.__init__` never fires:
//! `self.cards` is never built and `self.MAXVAL` is never set. `to_cardinal` is
//! overridden outright and drives a hand-rolled `_int_to_word` recursion.
//! Consequently `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and
//! there is **no overflow check** — arbitrarily large input is accepted (see
//! bug 3 below for what it returns).
//!
//! All in-scope modes are overridden by the Python class itself. Python's one
//! `to_cardinal` serves both integer and float input (its `"." in n` branch);
//! the Rust trait splits those, so the integer half lands in `to_cardinal` and
//! the fractional half in `to_cardinal_float` (see that method for the float/
//! Decimal port and its two out-of-corpus divergences):
//!   * `to_cardinal(n)`    -> the `_int_to_word` recursion, with sign handling
//!   * `to_ordinal(n)`     -> `to_cardinal(n) + "-و"`
//!   * `to_ordinal_num(n)` -> `str(n) + "."`  (note: *not* the base default,
//!     which returns `str(value)` with no dot)
//!   * `to_year(val, longval=True)` -> `to_cardinal(val)`, ignoring `longval`
//!     entirely. Identical to the base default, but overridden explicitly here
//!     to mirror the Python source.
//!
//! `Num2Word_SD` additionally overrides `to_currency` outright, but **not**
//! `to_cheque`, `pluralize`, `_money_verbose`, `_cents_verbose` or
//! `_cents_terse`; see "Currency" below.
//!
//! Nothing in this module reads or writes instance state across calls. The
//! struct below holds only the `CURRENCY_FORMS` table, built once in
//! [`LangSd::new`] (which the generated registry caches in a `OnceLock`) and
//! thereafter read-only, so the Python dispatcher's `_plain_int` handshake
//! caveat still does not apply.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. The following are all wrong-looking but are
//! exactly what Python emits, verified against the interpreter and against the
//! frozen corpus:
//!
//! 1. **`to_cardinal(0)` == `"zero"`** — the English word, in an otherwise
//!    all-Sindhi table. `_int_to_word` opens with
//!    `return self.ones[0] if self.ones[0] else "zero"`, and `ones[0]` is the
//!    empty string (a falsy placeholder so that `ones[n]` indexes by digit).
//!    The conditional therefore always takes the `"zero"` branch — the guard is
//!    dead. Modelled by [`ZERO`].
//! 2. **No teens.** Sindhi has distinct words for 11-19, but the `< 100` branch
//!    unconditionally composes `tens[n // 10] + " " + ones[n % 10]`. So 11 is
//!    "ڏهه هڪ" — literally "ten one" — 13 is "ڏهه ٽي", and 19 is "ڏهه نو". This
//!    propagates upward: 12345 == "ڏهه ٻه هزار ٽي سو چاليهه پنج" ("ten two
//!    thousand ..."). Preserved verbatim.
//! 3. **Everything >= 10^9 renders as bare ASCII digits.** The `_int_to_word`
//!    branch chain ends in `else: return str(number)  # Fallback for very large
//!    numbers`, so `to_cardinal(10**9)` == `"1000000000"` and
//!    `to_cardinal(10**21)` == `"1000000000000000000000"`. No exception, no
//!    words. Ordinal inherits it: `to_ordinal(10**9)` == `"1000000000-و"`.
//! 4. **`million` is "لک" (lakh) but is applied at 10^6.** A lakh is 10^5 in the
//!    South Asian system, so the scale name is off by a factor of ten, and the
//!    genuine Sindhi grouping (lakh/crore) is not used at all — the code groups
//!    in Western thousands/millions. Hence 10^6 == "هڪ لک" ("one lakh") and
//!    123456789 == "هڪ سو ويهه ٽي لک ..." ("one hundred twenty three lakh ...").
//! 5. **`negword` is the English "minus "**, not a Sindhi word, and it is
//!    *prepended* to right-to-left script: `to_cardinal(-1)` == "minus هڪ".
//! 6. Orthographic inconsistency in the tables, kept byte-exact: `ones[1]`
//!    ("هڪ") spells its kaf with U+06AA ARABIC LETTER SWASH KAF, while `million`
//!    ("لک") uses U+06A9 ARABIC LETTER KEHEH. These are distinct codepoints that
//!    render near-identically, so the tables below use explicit `\u{...}`
//!    escapes rather than pasted glyphs — a copy-paste round trip through an
//!    editor that normalises Arabic presentation forms would silently corrupt
//!    them, and the corpus compares bytes.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `to_currency` is overridden by the Python class and shares essentially
//! nothing with `Num2Word_Base.to_currency`: it never calls
//! `parse_currency_parts`, `pluralize`, `_cents_verbose` or `_cents_terse`, and
//! never consults `CURRENCY_PRECISION` or `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES`. It splits
//! `str(val)` on `"."` and works on the two halves textually. Consequences,
//! each verified against the live interpreter and the frozen corpus:
//!
//! 1. **An unknown currency code does not raise.** `to_currency` looks the code
//!    up with `CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, list(CURRENCY_FORMS.values())[0])`,
//!    so anything outside {PKR, USD, EUR} silently renders in Pakistani rupees —
//!    the first entry by insertion order. The corpus tests seven such codes
//!    (GBP, JPY, KWD, BHD, INR, CNY, CHF) and every row comes back in rupees and
//!    paisas. `to_cheque`, which SD does *not* override, keeps the base's plain
//!    `CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` subscript and so *does* raise for those same
//!    seven codes. The two entry points disagree, deliberately.
//! 2. **`CURRENCY_PRECISION` is ignored.** The subunit is always hundredths,
//!    hardcoded by the `parts[1][:2]` slice. There is no 3-decimal (KWD/BHD,
//!    divisor 1000) or 0-decimal (JPY, divisor 1) handling, and the base's
//!    zero-decimal rounding branch is unreachable. Since SD inherits
//!    `CURRENCY_PRECISION = {}` from `Num2Word_Base` those codes would resolve
//!    to 100 regardless, so this is invisible in the corpus — `currency:JPY` and
//!    `currency:KWD` render identically to `currency:PKR`, cents and all.
//! 3. **No rounding, only truncation.** `12.999` bills 99 cents and `2.675`
//!    bills 67 — the base path's `ROUND_HALF_UP` would give 100 and 68.
//! 4. **`adjective` is accepted and ignored**, so `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES` (empty
//!    anyway) is never read.
//! 5. **`cents=False` suppresses the cents segment entirely** rather than
//!    switching to terse digits as the base class does: the guard is
//!    `if cents and right:`, and a false `cents` drops the whole clause.
//!    `to_currency(12.34, cents=False)` == `"ڏهه ٻه euros"`.
//!
//! `to_cheque` is inherited unmodified and needs no override here: the base
//! implementation's hooks (`currency_forms`, `currency_precision` at its default
//! 100, `money_verbose` delegating to `to_cardinal`) already resolve to SD's
//! behaviour.
//!
//! # Known divergences
//!
//! Two, both outside the corpus, both stemming from information the
//! `CurrencyValue` boundary cannot carry:
//!
//! 1. **An explicit `separator=","` renders as `" "`.** The dispatcher
//!    substitutes `Num2Word_Base`'s `","` when the caller supplies no separator,
//!    so `","` has to be read as "unset" and replaced with SD's own `" "`
//!    default — which makes a deliberate `","` unrepresentable. Every other
//!    separator is honoured verbatim. The corpus evidence for resolving it this
//!    way, and the reason it cannot be fixed from inside this file, is on
//!    [`SEPARATOR_UNSET`].
//! 2. **Scientific-notation input raises `ValueError` in Python, not here.**
//!    `str(float)` switches to exponent form at `1e16` and below `1e-4`, and
//!    `int("1e+21")` then throws: `to_currency(1e21)` and `to_currency(1e-5)`
//!    are both `ValueError`. The shim hands the core `str(value)`, but
//!    `CurrencyValue::parse` turns it into a `BigDecimal`, which accepts
//!    exponent notation and discards the fact that it was used —
//!    `"1e-05"` and `"0.00001"` become indistinguishable. Reproducing the raise
//!    would need the original string. This path renders the value instead (via
//!    bug 3's digit fallback for the large case). No corpus row reaches it.
//!
//! # Error variants
//!
//! `to_cheque` raises `N2WError::NotImplemented` for a code absent from
//! `CURRENCY_FORMS`, via the inherited `currency::default_to_cheque` and the
//! [`Lang::lang_name`] override below — Python's
//! `NotImplementedError: Currency code "GBP" not implemented for "Num2Word_SD"`,
//! reached through the `KeyError` that `to_cheque`'s bare subscript throws.
//!
//! Otherwise none. The four integer modes and `to_currency` have no reachable
//! crash site and no deliberate `raise`: every list index is derived from a digit
//! of a value already bounded by the enclosing branch, so `ones[i]`/`tens[i]` can
//! only be hit with `i` in `0..=9`. With no `MAXVAL` there is no `OverflowError`
//! either (bug 3 swallows the large-input case). `pluralize` is left at the
//! trait default that raises, matching `Num2Word_Base.pluralize` — SD reaches it
//! from neither `to_currency` (which inlines its own two-form selection) nor
//! `to_cheque` (which takes `cr1[-1]` directly).
