//! Port of `lang_HMN.py` (Hmong).
//!
//! Registry check: `CONVERTER_CLASSES["hmn"]` is `lang_HMN.Num2Word_HMN`
//! (`__init__.py:385`), which is the class ported here.
//!
//! Shape: **self-contained**. `Num2Word_HMN` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` but
//! defines no `high_numwords` / `mid_numwords` / `low_numwords`, so the
//! `hasattr` guard in `Num2Word_Base.__init__` never fires: `self.cards` is
//! never built and `self.MAXVAL` is never set. `to_cardinal` is overridden
//! outright and drives `_int_to_word` recursively. Consequently
//! `cards`/`maxval`/`merge` stay at their trait defaults here, and there is
//! **no overflow check at all** — see bug 1 below for what happens instead.
//!
//! Every in-scope method is overridden by Python, so nothing is inherited
//! from `Num2Word_Base` except `__init__`'s attribute defaults, which
//! `setup()` then overwrites. `is_title` stays `False`, so `title()` is a
//! no-op and `exclude_title` (`["thiab", "lab", "tsis", "txaus"]`) is dead
//! weight — it is never consulted on any of the four in-scope paths.
//!
//! # Faithfully reproduced Python bugs and oddities
//!
//! This is a port, not a rewrite. All of the following look wrong but are
//! exactly what Python emits:
//!
//! 1. **`_int_to_word` falls through to `str(number)` at 10^9.** The chain of
//!    `if number < ...` guards stops at `1000000000`, and the final statement
//!    is a bare `return str(number)`. So `to_cardinal(10**9)` returns the
//!    *digit string* `"1000000000"`, not words — no exception, no overflow
//!    error. Corpus confirms this for 10^9 through 10^21. Negatives compose:
//!    `to_cardinal(-10**9)` == `"tsis txaus 1000000000"`, and
//!    `to_ordinal(10**9)` == `"thib 1000000000"`. This is why the value must
//!    stay a `BigInt` — the fallback has to print arbitrary precision exactly.
//!
//! 2. **The tens table mixes two spellings of the same morpheme.** 30–50 use
//!    "caug" ("peb caug", "plaub caug", "tsib caug") while 60–90 use "caum"
//!    ("rau caum", "xya caum", "yim caum", "cuaj caum"). Preserved verbatim.
//!
//! 3. **"tawm rau" for million, "lab" for the decimal point.** `self.million`
//!    is "tawm rau" (literally "out six"), while "lab" — the actual Hmong
//!    word for a million — is used as `pointword` instead. Both are kept as
//!    written; only `million` is in scope here.
//!
//! 4. **Inconsistent joiners.** Hundreds glue their remainder with `" thiab "`
//!    ("and"), but thousands and millions glue theirs with a plain space. So
//!    101 == "ib puas thiab ib" while 1001 == "ib txhiab ib".
//!
//! 5. **No scale word between thousand and million.** There is no "hundred
//!    thousand" grouping: 100000 == "ib puas txhiab" ("one hundred thousand"
//!    built as 100 × txhiab).
//!
//! 6. **`to_ordinal` accepts negatives and zero without complaint**, unlike
//!    most modules — it never calls `verify_ordinal`. `to_ordinal(0)` ==
//!    "thib xoom", `to_ordinal(-1)` == "thib tsis txaus ib".
//!
//! No cross-call mutable state: `setup()` only assigns constant tables, and
//! no method sets a flag that another consumes. The stateless Rust path is
//! faithful.
//!
//! # Float / Decimal cardinal path
//!
//! `Num2Word_HMN` does **not** override `to_cardinal_float`; its overridden
//! `to_cardinal` handles non-integers inline, entirely through `str(number)`:
//!
//! ```python
//! n = str(number).strip()
//! if n.startswith("-"):
//!     return (self.negword + self.to_cardinal(n[1:])).strip()
//! if "." in n:
//!     left, right = n.split(".", 1)
//!     ret = self._int_to_word(int(left)) + " " + self.pointword
//!     for digit in right:
//!         ret += " " + (self.ones[int(digit)] or "xoom")
//!     return ret.strip()
//! return self._int_to_word(int(n))
//! ```
//!
//! It never touches `base.float2tuple`, the `< 0.01` rounding heuristic, or
//! `precision=`. So this port reconstructs `str(number)` — Python's `repr`
//! for a `float`, `Decimal.__str__` for a `Decimal` — and runs that string
//! algorithm verbatim. Consequences, all reproduced:
//!
//! 11. **The fractional part is taken digit-for-digit from `str(number)`, not
//!     rounded.** `2.675` -> "ob lab rau xya tsib" (digits 6-7-5 straight from
//!     the repr), `1.005` -> "ib lab xoom xoom tsib". A `0` digit prints
//!     "xoom" (`ones[0]` is "" -> `or "xoom"`); every other digit is `ones[d]`,
//!     which for a single digit equals `_int_to_word(d)`.
//!
//! 12. **`precision=` is ignored.** HMN's `to_cardinal` takes no precision
//!     argument and reads no `self.precision`, so the kwarg the facade threads
//!     through has no effect: `num2words(12.34, lang="hmn", precision=5)` ==
//!     `num2words(12.34, lang="hmn")`. `precision_override` is dropped here.
//!
//! 13. **Scientific-notation `str(number)` raises `ValueError`, never renders.**
//!     When `str` goes exponential, either there is no "." (`"1e+16"`,
//!     `"1E+3"`, `"1E-7"`) so `int(n)` chokes on the whole token, or the "."
//!     splits a mantissa that still runs into the exponent marker (`"1.5e+17"`
//!     -> `right == "5e+17"`, and `int("e")` fails in the digit loop). Both
//!     surface as `ValueError`. A float's repr goes scientific at a shortest
//!     decimal exponent `>= 16` or `<= -5` (Python's `decpt > 16 || decpt <=
//!     -4`); a `Decimal.__str__` goes scientific at `exponent > 0` or
//!     `adjusted < -6`. Reconstructing the exact `str` and feeding it through
//!     `int()` reproduces both the raise *and* the quoted literal.
//!
//! 14. **The sign comes from `str(number)`, which is why `-0.0` keeps its
//!     negword.** `str(-0.0)` is `"-0.0"`, so `startswith("-")` fires and the
//!     result is "tsis txaus xoom lab xoom" — even though `-0.0 < 0` is False.
//!     For a `float` the sign is `f64::is_sign_negative()` (the repr's "-").
//!     For a `Decimal` the sign rides on the `BigDecimal`; a *negative zero*
//!     `Decimal("-0.0")`/`Decimal("-0")` is the one input this port cannot
//!     reproduce — `BigDecimal` has no signed zero, so the "-" is gone before
//!     the core sees it. See `concerns`; it is pathological and unattested.
//!
//! # Currency
//!
//! `Num2Word_HMN` subclasses `Num2Word_Base` **directly**, not `Num2Word_EUR`,
//! and declares its own three-entry `CURRENCY_FORMS` class attribute. So the
//! `lang_EUR.py` mutation trap does not apply here: `Num2Word_EN.__init__`
//! rewrites `Num2Word_EUR.CURRENCY_FORMS` in place, but HMN never reads that
//! dict. Verified against the live interpreter — HMN sees exactly
//! `{USD, EUR, LAK}`, `CURRENCY_PRECISION == {}` and
//! `CURRENCY_ADJECTIVES == {}`.
//!
//! Consequences of those two empty dicts:
//!
//! * `currency_precision` stays at the trait default 100 for **every** code.
//!   HMN has no 3-decimal and no 0-decimal currency, so KWD/BHD render with a
//!   divisor of 100 and JPY still shows subunits. The corpus confirms it:
//!   `currency:KWD 12.34` and `currency:JPY 12.34` both come out identical to
//!   USD. Do not "fix" this by importing EN's precision table — EN *rebinds*
//!   `CURRENCY_PRECISION` on itself, so nothing leaks to HMN.
//! * `currency_adjective` stays `None`, and HMN's `to_currency` ignores its
//!   `adjective=` argument outright, so `adjective=True` is a silent no-op.
//!
//! `to_currency` is overridden wholesale and shares nothing with
//! `Num2Word_Base.to_currency` — see bugs 7-9. `to_cheque`, `_money_verbose`,
//! `_cents_verbose` and `_cents_terse` are all inherited unchanged, so the
//! trait defaults already mirror them and only the data tables, `lang_name`
//! and `pluralize` need overriding.
//!
//! ## More faithfully reproduced Python bugs
//!
//! 7. **`to_currency` never raises for an unknown code.** It does
//!    `self.CURRENCY_FORMS.get(currency, list(self.CURRENCY_FORMS.values())[0])`,
//!    so GBP/JPY/KWD/BHD/INR/CNY/CHF silently borrow **USD's** forms and print
//!    "nyiaj kub"/"xees" instead of raising NotImplementedError. `to_cheque`,
//!    inherited from Base, does `self.CURRENCY_FORMS[currency]` and *does*
//!    raise — so the same code succeeds through one entry point and fails
//!    through the other. The corpus pins both halves. See [`FALLBACK_CODE`].
//!
//! 8. **Cents are truncated, not rounded.** `parts[1][:2]` slices the first two
//!    fractional characters off `str(val)`, so 2.675 -> 67 cents, and 1.005 ->
//!    0 cents (and therefore no cents segment at all). Base's `to_currency`
//!    would ROUND_HALF_UP to 68 and 1 respectively. HMN never calls
//!    `parse_currency_parts`, so none of that applies.
//!
//! 9. **`str(val).split(".")` mangles exponential `repr`s.** `str(1e16)` is
//!    "1e+16", which contains no ".", so `parts == ["1e+16"]` and `int()`
//!    raises `ValueError` — not any currency error. But a longer coefficient
//!    does not raise, it *lies*: `str(Decimal("1.01E+7"))` splits into
//!    `["1", "01E+7"]`, so ten million renders as "ib nyiaj kub ib xees" —
//!    one dollar one cent — with the exponent silently read as cents. Only 1-
//!    and 2-digit coefficients raise. See [`split_currency`], which also
//!    documents the one band this port cannot reproduce.
//!
//! 10. **Bug 1 leaks into currency.** `to_currency` calls `_int_to_word`, so a
//!     unit amount >= 10^9 prints as digits: `to_currency(10**9, "USD")` ==
//!     "1000000000 nyiaj kub".

///
/// So a 3+-digit coefficient *succeeds*, reading the exponent as if it were

/// interpreter for both `float` and `Decimal`, which agree throughout: the
/// mantissa is normalised to one leading digit by both `repr(float)` and
/// `Decimal.__str__`, and `parts[1][:2]` never reaches past it.
///
/// Deciding *whether* `str(val)` was scientific is the whole difficulty, since
/// the notation is chosen by the producer and then dissolved by
/// `CurrencyValue::parse`. Three of the four cases are recoverable:
///
/// * `scale < 0` — exponent > 0. A plain decimal string always parses to
///   `scale >= 0`, and a `float` only reaches a negative scale when its repr
///   already went scientific. Exact for both producers.
/// * `scale == 0` with `has_decimal` — a `Decimal` at scale 0 prints as a
///   plain integer (no dot, so `has_decimal` would be false), and a plain
///   `float` repr always carries at least ".0" (scale >= 1). So a dot at scale
///   0 can only be a scientific mantissa: `1.2345678901234568e+16`.
/// * `scale > 0` without `has_decimal` — no dot, yet a fraction exists. A
///   plain decimal string with fractional digits always has a dot, so this is
///   `Decimal("1E-7")`.
///
/// The fourth is **irreducibly ambiguous and this port diverges**. `float` and
/// `Decimal` disagree about when to go scientific — `repr(float)` switches
/// below 1e-4, `Decimal.__str__` only below 1e-6 (adjusted exponent < -6) —
/// so for `|x|` in `[1e-6, 1e-4)` the notation depends on a type that no
/// longer exists here. `1e-05` and `Decimal("0.00001")` both arrive as
/// `digits=1, scale=5, has_decimal=true`: identical, yet Python raises
/// ValueError for the first and returns "xoom nyiaj kub" for the second. The
/// exponent is present in the `str(value)` the shim sends and is consumed by
/// `parse` before this code runs, so nothing in this file can recover it.
/// This branch takes the `Decimal` reading. See `concerns`.
///
/// Both Err arms quote a literal (`'1e+21'`, `'5E'`) that the parsed value
/// cannot reproduce; the exception *type* is what a caller catches, and that
/// is exact.
///
/// On the plain path, `ljust(2, "0")` right-pads, so fractional trailing zeros
/// cannot matter: dropping them never changes the first two characters once
/// the slice is padded back out to two. `BigDecimal` happens not to normalize
/// on parse ("5.00" stays `digits=500, scale=2`), but this would hold either
